Following @nicksortor's  arrest in Portland, I think the federal government should stop all grants and contracts to the city. Between 2021 and 2025, these totaled over $5 billion, with the Department of War (formerly DOD) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) each spending $1.66 billion.

Email Communications: 
Unfulfilled Promises and Constituent Support
Dear @SpanbergerForVA, 
When you served in the House of Representatives, I met with one of your senior staff members in your Woodbridge, VA office, who made significant promises to assist me as a constituent. Unfortunately, those commitments were not honored, and my follow-up emails have been ignored. If your office struggles to support an individual constituent, how can you be trusted to effectively serve the millions of residents in Virginia? 
Attached below is the email exchange between myself and your staff member for Virginians to see who you really are 

Sincerely,
```

**Content**:
```
IOM Germany: On July 15, 2023, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Germany received a grant of $31.5 million to facilitate the processing of Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applications. However, concerns have been raised about the integrity of this process due to past issues. In 2010, the IOM was found to have falsified SIV and I-94 application documents, leading to the temporary suspension of the SIV program by the U.S. Department of State. Allegations suggest that the IOM charged applicants 10k to use authentic documents originally belonging to individuals who had worked with coalition forces, altering the names to facilitate immigration. 
I personally know five individuals from Iraq successfully immigrated to the United States through this method. Given this history, there are concerns that the recent funding to IOM Germany may involve processing unvetted Afghan applicants for U.S. entry. 
@DataRepublican just did a thread on this and how profitable illegal immigration is. 
PS if you read this comment, reshare and follow me for more. Thanks!

THREAD: Honduras as a case study for mass migraton

I poked around into the Honduras story a bit more thanks to prodding from a subscriber. The subscriber insisted that there had to be beneficiaries or the "closed loop" where destabilization -> displacement -> resettlement would not have gone on so long unnoticed. 

And, yes, the history of Honduras is very much interesting and educational... and I'm going to try my best to share what I've collected below

Seems you may be Ralph Hutton, a personal trainer and fitness coach for 9round in Springfield, VA.   Your Unlimited retail company doesn't show much movement, you were a Habitat for Humanity truck driver for a while, and a salesperson for a pawn broker.

If your latest gig is really 9round (https://x.com/9Round) you aren't abiding by their core principles --LOVE PEOPLE. Personal trainers and fitness coaches are supposed to be positive motivators, not sure Heather and Shannon Hudson, founders of 9round, would be ok with one of their fitness instructors spreading false criminal information online, which is actually NOT protected free speech.  Their core values per their website: The 9Round brand leads with love. It shines in our training style and our passion for helping people lead healthier lives.

In my opinion, your X account doesn't spread much love. The goal seems to be personal attacks for the sake of growing an X account.

Do better. Speak out all you want, even if we don't agree with you, but do it with truth, not made up crap.

Jeffrey Epstein: I’m uncertain about how to approach this, but it’s time to share some truth. During my time in the intelligence community, I searched for Epstein-related files on the Top Secret Network, including JWICS, SION (the FBI’s top-secret database), and GOLD. I found no records in Datatree, CELLEX, XRY, DIA reporting, NSA Pules, or CIA Wires, except for a single Intelligence Information Report (IIR) from 2004, which was sparse. It’s possible the files were never digitized due to incomplete big data integration. I suspect most original files have been destroyed by now, and the FBI is being misled. Under 18 U.S.C. § 793, the government can destroy evidence without question.

**Content**:
```
FORT BRAGG, North Carolina – Base housing debacle, Instagram photos showcase a lavish, crimson banquet hall at Capard House, a 100-acre Irish estate with two 18th-century mansions. Owned by Rhode Island real estate developer John Picerne, the estate boasts gilded mirrors, blue damask wallpaper, and a new personal golf course, redecorated with a top interior designer’s help. Meanwhile, tenant photos from North Carolina, Maryland, and Louisiana reveal a stark contrast: military homes plagued by flooding, burst pipes, mold, collapsed ceilings, exposed lead paint, and brown tap water. Picerne, through his company Corvias Group, controls both the luxurious Irish estate and these troubled residences. Since 2002, Corvias has managed over 26,000 homes and apartments on 13 U.S. military bases under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, a 22-year-old program that privatized 206,000 federal housing units. Partnering with the Army and Air Force, Corvias builds, upgrades, and manages these properties for 50 years, generating hundreds of millions in annual rent from service members. The military claims the initiative improves living conditions for families, despite ongoing issues.

The reason I'm writing about this because I received a complaint from a military personal who lives on base housing in Ft Bragg. Also the Military Housing Privatization Initiative was created to hide the funding these companies receives and I validated that by looking up Corvias funding and I found only 350k from the mid 2000's which tracks with when the program started and why there is no funding after because of the privatization Act . 

PS Reuters reported on this issue back in 2018 and nothing changed. 
@PeteHegseth @SecDef This issue needs to be addressed and the funding should be public and transparent.

FORT BRAGG, North Carolina – Base housing debacle, Instagram photos showcase a lavish, crimson banquet hall at Capard House, a 100-acre Irish estate with two 18th-century mansions. Owned by Rhode Island real estate developer John Picerne, the estate boasts gilded mirrors, blue damask wallpaper, and a new personal golf course, redecorated with a top interior designer’s help. Meanwhile, tenant photos from North Carolina, Maryland, and Louisiana reveal a stark contrast: military homes plagued by flooding, burst pipes, mold, collapsed ceilings, exposed lead paint, and brown tap water. Picerne, through his company Corvias Group, controls both the luxurious Irish estate and these troubled residences. Since 2002, Corvias has managed over 26,000 homes and apartments on 13 U.S. military bases under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, a 22-year-old program that privatized 206,000 federal housing units. Partnering with the Army and Air Force, Corvias builds, upgrades, and manages these properties for 50 years, generating hundreds of millions in annual rent from service members. The military claims the initiative improves living conditions for families, despite ongoing issues.

Buckle up for a jaw-dropping reveal! Introducing PLOWSHARE GROUP, INC., the ultimate money making machine that’s struck gold with nearly $1 BILLION in contracts from HHS alone! One juicy deal? A staggering $458.8M contract running from 2020 to September 2025, with $268.4M already poured into get this the "CDC National Tobacco Education Campaign." Sounds noble, but is it? A quick peek at their website uncovers deep ties to NGOs and a donation trail that’s 100% blue, funneling every penny to Democrats. Coincidence or calculated? This isn’t just a cash flow it’s a cash flood! Dig deeper and follow the money!

USAID Ran Disinformation Campaign to Influence Sierra Leone Presidential Election
On June 24, 2023, Julius Maada was reelected as president, reportedly aided by a USAID disinformation campaign launched in 2022 to support his reelection. The campaign targeted women and unspecified minority groups in Sierra Leone, though the nature of these minorities is unclear given the country's predominantly Black population. The operation was funded with $4.0 million.

Based on the latest update by congress CFIUS responsibilities. 
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), chaired by the Treasury Secretary, reviews foreign direct investment (FDI) for national security risks. It examines mergers, acquisitions, takeovers, certain noncontrolling investments in critical technologies, infrastructure, or sensitive data, and specific real estate deals.

The truth came out

DC Lobbyist Desirée Townsend spoke with Congress Reps. The REAL REASON Democrats are fighting for illegal’s healthcare is because states like California have so many illegals their entire healthcare system runs on the taxpayer money for illegals

“Let's take California, for example.
California has a high demographic of individuals that are not here legally, and prior to the expansion of healthcare for them, the hospitals were inundated with people they could not handle. And so, when that expansion happened and immigrants who are here, undocumented immigrants that are here were able to get insurance, all of a sudden, you then had this new kind of revenue stream that came in not only to the hospitals but now to all these doctors and providers in California.

— California will be a catastrophe because you'll have all of these individuals now that are not documented with no health insurance. So, all of the providers that were making money off of this kind of, like, new economics in California are- are now not gonna be making any money. 

And instead, these individuals that are undocumented are gonna have to go to the hospital for treatment, and that's going to, instead of make the hospital money because they're covered by Medicaid, it's going to create a situation where now the hospitals are losing millions of dollars.

So, that is what I believe the sticking point is with Medicaid with Democrats. It has to do with a situation in states like California where you have millions and millions of undocumented individuals, um, and if they lose insurance, not only will the providers now not make money and the hospitals are not making money”

Thread: Could Seeding In Texas. First lets explore what's cloud Seeding is. Cloud seeding in Texas is a weather modification technique aimed at enhancing rainfall to combat drought, replenish water supplies, and support agriculture. It involves dispersing substances like silver iodide or calcium chloride into clouds to stimulate precipitation, typically using aircraft to release these materials into convective clouds (cumulus or thunderstorms). The practice has been used in Texas since the 1950s, with modern programs regulated by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) under the Texas Weather Modification Act of 1967.

I researched government spending on Independence Day events and food catering, totaling $881,716.53 across various agencies. I used the keyword independence Day this time, the other day I did one using the keyword 4th of July and the total for that was over 500K. Here are some examples:

Why is the U.S. government spending over $70 million on luxury Hyatt hotel rooms, especially given that the Pritzker family, with significant influence, holds a major stake in Hyatt Hotels Corporation?

By the way DOD takes the cake with overall spending with $51.8 million and just one contract for $16.9 Million between Jan 10, 2021 to Sep 30, 2021.

Pritzker Influence: The Pritzker family, with a 3.8% equity stake and 88.8% voting power in Hyatt Hotels Corporation, benefits indirectly from government contracts.

Fourth of July Government Spending: Your Tax Dollars at Work?If you're pinching pennies to cover bills and can't afford to celebrate Independence Day, here's something to chew on. The Department of the Interior (DOI) dropped $546,780 on June 2, 2025, for a 4th of July bash. On June 11, 2025, the State Department shelled out $18,630, while another State Department division spent $12,205 on June 12, 2025. Not to be outdone, a different DOI division allocated $35,992 on June 27, 2025. Government officials are partying hard on your taxpayer dollars.

 Iranian state hackers just launched the most sophisticated phishing campaign I've ever seen

The "Educated Manticore" group (aka APT42, Charming Kitten, Mint Sandstorm) - linked directly to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Intelligence Organization - is using AI to craft perfect emails targeting Israeli cybersecurity professors and tech experts.
Zero typos, flawless grammar, professional tone - completely indistinguishable from legitimate communication. But some sharp targets caught tiny details like name mismatches in email headers.

Clinton Health Access Initiative Caught in the Crosshairs!
Chelsea Clinton’s fuming as RFK Jr. shakes up the vaccine game, exposing the Clinton Foundation’s shady schemes. A fiery Republican @DataRepublican  already roasted her, and we’re here to fan the flames! The Clinton Foundation’s pet project, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, is bleeding cash as reforms threaten to drain their piggy bank dry. 
Spilling the tea: they’ve been pocketing millions in grants, like $3.5M from the University of Nebraska (2021-2026), $1.05M from Duke via NASA (04/28/2025), and a whopping $14M+. Time to pull the plug on their grift!

Clinton Health Access Initiative Caught in the Crosshairs!
Chelsea Clinton’s fuming as RFK Jr. shakes up the vaccine game, exposing the Clinton Foundation’s shady schemes. A fiery Republican @DataRepublican  already roasted her, and we’re here to fan the flames! The Clinton Foundation’s pet project, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, is bleeding cash as reforms threaten to drain their piggy bank dry. 
Spilling the tea: they’ve been pocketing millions in grants, like $3.5M from the University of Nebraska (2021-2026), $1.05M from Duke via NASA (04/28/2025), and a whopping $14M+. Time to pull the plug on their grift!

NIH Racist Health Equity funding. 
On October 14, 2022, Pulse 2.0 reported that the University of Miami was awarded a $1.3 million grant to develop AI for addressing health disparities. This initiative is part of the university’s leadership in the NIH’s AIM-AHEAD program, focusing on AI and machine learning to promote health equity and researcher diversity. The grant supports collaboration with historically Black colleges, tribal colleges, and other minority-serving institutions to build a computing framework for sharing de-identified patient data, enhancing healthcare research quality and scope. 
The project is led by Azizi Seixas and Nicholas Tsinoremas. (Funding details in part two.)

OnlyFans And Ukrainian Ties Unveiled: The Billionaire Powering Your Feed.
Millions pour money into OnlyFans for exclusive content, but who’s behind it? 
Leonid Radvinsky, a Ukrainian-American billionaire who owns Fenix International, the company running OnlyFans. After securing full control in 2018, he drove the platform to a staggering $1.3 billion in 2023 revenue. 

But Radvinsky’s reach goes further—his empire spans:

MyFreeCams: A major adult webcam platform he launched in 2004.

Cybertania Inc.: A controversial web referral business he co-founded at 17.

Leo: A venture fund fueling tech startups like B4X and Pleroma.
Radvinsky isn’t just profiting—he’s redefining digital culture. When you subscribe, you’re part of his bold vision.
A Curious Aside:
OnlyFans and CodePink? 
Could there be a link through feminist ideals? CodePink champions anti-militarist feminism, pushing for peace and justice. OnlyFans’ CEO, Keily Blair, claims the platform empowers women, especially in sex work, by offering financial freedom. Yet, CodePink’s anti-capitalist ethos clashes with OnlyFans’ profit-driven model, often criticized for exploiting vulnerabilities. No direct ties exist—CodePink hasn’t addressed OnlyFans, and their feminist visions diverge sharply. Just an intriguing contrast in how women’s empowerment is framed.

FYI Andrew Tate was demonized by doing the same @Cobratate. I am vouching for anyone, I am seeking for your opinions at this point.

Exposé on Samidoun: Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network Funding
Samidoun, a Palestinian activist group, lacks transparency in its financial disclosures, leaving much of its funding structure opaque. However, investigations into available sources reveal key details about its financial backers and their contributions:
Alliance for Global Justice (AFGJ): Acts as a fiscal sponsor for Samidoun. AFGJ received a $258,673.96 SBA loan, raising questions about whether it was repaid and how much, if any, was funneled to Samidoun.

1- Tides Foundation: Provided nearly $300,000 in grants to Samidoun, funded indirectly through taxpayer money, highlighting public funds supporting the group’s activities.

2- Open Society Foundations: Backed by George Soros, this organization has contributed to Samidoun, aligning with its broader funding of activist causes.

3- New Venture Fund: Received $2.9 million from USAID and $522,000 from the U.S. Department of State, some of which supported Samidoun’s operations, indicating significant government-backed financing.

4- Arnold Ventures: Contributed over $3.2 million, with portions of this funding originating from government sources, further entangling Samidoun with public money.

These findings expose a complex web of funding, blending private, nonprofit, and government sources, raising concerns about accountability and the true scope of Samidoun’s financial network. @DataRepublican will help with the web of none government fundings.

Considered a terrorist organization by many including Canada where they are based, they support paid Hamas protestors who want the elimination of Israel as their ONE STATE solution.

Money donated by Soros to Tides Foundation to Alliance For Global Justice to Popular Front for the liberation of Palestine and SAMIDOUN. . Lot of money laundering to hide the source. 

Did I see in the future the Soros money is confiscated because of Crimes Against Humanity? And Soros is no more!

I received the following email from CODEPINK.

"We are writing to formally address and correct the false and defamatory statements made in your recent social media posts regarding CODEPINK. These claims—which falsely allege that our organization is funded by China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or any foreign government or entity—are entirely baseless and constitute libel." 

So, I will share the facts without spin: 

Per Wikipedia, CODEPINK is 25% funded by Neville Singham, who is living in Shanghai and got rich off spreading CCP propaganda, and is under investigation by Congress for FARA violations. 

CODEPINK is running a campaign called "China is Not Our Enemy," which promotes pro-China messaging, including denial of the Uyghur genocide, an atrocity affirmed by the U.S. Department of State.

The founder of CODEPINK, Jodie Evans, is married to the aforementioned Neville Singham. 

In fact, the Uyghur denialism goes so far that Jodie Evans said in a YouTube interview, that Uyghurs are terrorists trained in Yemen and Syria who bomb shopping centers.

I received the following email from CODEPINK.

"We are writing to formally address and correct the false and defamatory statements made in your recent social media posts regarding CODEPINK. These claims—which falsely allege that our organization is funded by China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or any foreign government or entity—are entirely baseless and constitute libel." 

So, I will share the facts without spin: 

Per Wikipedia, CODEPINK is 25% funded by Neville Singham, who is living in Shanghai and got rich off spreading CCP propaganda, and is under investigation by Congress for FARA violations. 

CODEPINK is running a campaign called "China is Not Our Enemy," which promotes pro-China messaging, including denial of the Uyghur genocide, an atrocity affirmed by the U.S. Department of State.

The founder of CODEPINK, Jodie Evans, is married to the aforementioned Neville Singham. 

In fact, the Uyghur denialism goes so far that Jodie Evans said in a YouTube interview, that Uyghurs are terrorists trained in Yemen and Syria who bomb shopping centers.

Fog  of War: If anyone say Israel used October 7th for additional agenda then read the below It will give you a pretty good historical background.  

Subject: Historical Overview of Iran’s Nuclear Program

This post provides a concise, factual overview of Iran’s nuclear program from a historical perspective, focusing on its origins and development. The content is presented neutrally, without reference to specific geopolitical interests or recent events involving other nations.

1- Origins and Development of Iran’s Nuclear Program
 Iran’s nuclear program was initiated in the 1950s under the Shah’s regime, with support from the United States through the "Atoms for Peace" initiative. The Tehran Research Reactor, supplied by the U.S., became operational in 1967, marking the program’s early focus on civilian nuclear energy. Plans were established for multiple nuclear power plants to meet domestic energy needs. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the      program was temporarily halted but resumed in the 1980s, with Iran seeking partnerships with countries such as Russia and China. In the 2000s, Iran      intensified its uranium enrichment activities, particularly at facilities like Natanz, which sparked international concerns regarding the potential dual use nature of its nuclear capabilities.

2- Significant Disruption of Enrichment Activities
In 2010, Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility experienced a significant setback due to a cyberattack involving a sophisticated computer virus known as Stuxnet. The malware targeted the control systems of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment, causing malfunctions that disrupted operations. Widely regarded as a landmark event in cyber warfare, the attack is estimated to have delayed Iran’s nuclear program by one to two years. While the origins of Stuxnet remain unconfirmed by official sources, it has been extensively analyzed in reports, including those by major publications like The New York Times.

3- Historical Context of International Concerns
The development of Iran’s nuclear program over decades has drawn significant international attention, particularly regarding its enrichment capabilities. The program’s progression from civilian energy goals to      advanced enrichment activities has been a focal point of global diplomatic and security discussions, reflecting long-standing concerns about nuclear proliferation.

PS. Israel been trying to take out Iran nuclear capability for decades

Subject: Urgent Recommendations for Secure Troop Deployments
Dear @SecDef @PeteHegseth 

To safeguard our troops during deployments, I strongly recommend the following measures to enhance operational security:

1- Secure Electronic Devices: Prior to any troop movements, collect all personal electronic devices to prevent unauthorized recordings or leaks that could compromise missions. This step ensures our forces remain stealthy and secure.

2- Ban Garmin Devices: Implement a policy prohibiting Garmin watches during deployments. In 2017, an incident in Iraq exposed how these devices’ public geolocation data jeopardized troop safety. Let’s eliminate this vulnerability.

3- Enforce GPS Restrictions: Upon arrival at deployment destinations, mandate that NCOs verify all soldiers’, sailors’, airmen’s, and marines’ phone GPS settings are disabled. This critical check minimizes the risk of geolocation-based targeting by adversaries.

By adopting these proactive measures, we can significantly reduce risks and protect our service members. Thank you for prioritizing their safety.

Sincerely,
Alladdin,

Subject: Urgent Recommendations for Secure Troop Deployments
Dear @SecDef @PeteHegseth 

To safeguard our troops during deployments, I strongly recommend the following measures to enhance operational security:

1- Secure Electronic Devices: Prior to any troop movements, collect all personal electronic devices to prevent unauthorized recordings or leaks that could compromise missions. This step ensures our forces remain stealthy and secure.

2- Ban Garmin Devices: Implement a policy prohibiting Garmin watches during deployments. In 2017, an incident in Iraq exposed how these devices’ public geolocation data jeopardized troop safety. Let’s eliminate this vulnerability.

3- Enforce GPS Restrictions: Upon arrival at deployment destinations, mandate that NCOs verify all soldiers’, sailors’, airmen’s, and marines’ phone GPS settings are disabled. This critical check minimizes the risk of geolocation-based targeting by adversaries.

By adopting these proactive measures, we can significantly reduce risks and protect our service members. Thank you for prioritizing their safety.

Sincerely,
Alladdin,

DoD's mRNA Funding Bombshell Long before the COVID-19 crisis gripped the world, the Department of Defense was quietly pouring millions into mRNA development. In a jaw-dropping move, a 2015 grant funneled a staggering $57.9 million to Moderna TX, fueling the rise of mRNA technology in the shadows.
This is just one grant. There are so many out there.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is pushing $800,000 to launch an offshore wind training program at SUNY Maritime College. This 12-month project will train and certify 150+ students and pros yearly, with a certified instructor, a decked-out vessel, a crew transfer platform, and scholarships. Set to supercharge the college’s rep and revenue, it’s a bold move for students, workers, and the green energy revolution!

Hello @RealCandaceO 
Pushing folks to dodge orders and risk dishonorable discharge over disagreements with leadership is like handing them a career death sentence. It’s reckless advice—here’s why it’s a terrible idea:

1- Sworn Duty: Service members vow to defend the Constitution and follow the Commander-in-Chief’s orders. Deploying on command is in the contract they signed—non-negotiable.

2- Career Killer: Encouraging disobedience could lead to an Article 15 and a dishonorable discharge. That’s a lifelong stain, stripping them of veteran status and benefits. Will you offer them a job to fix that mess?

3- No Vet Protections: A dishonorable discharge means no veteran-protected status for jobs. They’re left high and dry in the civilian world.

4- Permanent Consequences: That discharge haunts their record forever, locking them out of hard-earned benefits like healthcare and education.

Ditch your military career? That’s not just bad advice—it’s a slap in the face to your sacrifice. Think hard. A dishonorable discharge means explaining to employers why your training certs come with a side of stigma, not veteran status.

My Advise to LG19 do not listen to Candace.

Progress Action Fund:  The below video is been advertised on social media and @RepSwalwell
reshared it to amplify it.  Here's my findings. Progress Action Fund (PAF) PAC was founded and lead by Joe Jacobson in August 2020  a former Obama administration alum.

Joe Jacobson Founded the below companies Couple of them received Gov funding directly: 
1- Joe Jacobson (McKinley Capital Management, LLC): Head of Private Equity at McKinley Alaska, with prior roles at McDowell Group and Huna Totem Corporation.

2- Joe Jacobson (Jacobson Technologies): President with experience in software and system development since 1989.  3- Joe Jacobson (Jacobson Press P.C.): President and trial attorney in St. Louis, previously with Green Jacobson, P.C., focusing on civil litigation and business disputes.  

3- Joseph Jacobson (MIT Media Lab): Founder of E Ink Corporation, Gen9, Inc., and Kovio, and a professor at MIT, known for inventing E Ink technology.  

4- Joe Jacobsen (Jacobsen Holz Corp.): President, Founder, and CEO of this company.  

PS this is the important part. Joseph Jacobson (MIT Media Lab):  Gen9, Inc., and a professor at MIT, known for inventing E Ink technology.   MIT Media Lab received and obligated amount for for 2 million dollars from NASA in which 1.5 already dispersed and still 6 month left into this project.  

 Also, Gen9, Inc., received 1.36 millions between 2014 and 2016 from the Department of Commerce (DOC).   He started his PAC based on his direct benefits of gov contracts and Tax payers fundings.

Joe Jacobson Founded the below companies Couple of them received Gov funding directly: 
1- Joe Jacobson (McKinley Capital Management, LLC): Head of Private Equity at McKinley Alaska, with prior roles at McDowell Group and Huna Totem Corporation.

2- Joe Jacobson (Jacobson Technologies): President with experience in software and system development since 1989.  3- Joe Jacobson (Jacobson Press P.C.): President and trial attorney in St. Louis, previously with Green Jacobson, P.C., focusing on civil litigation and business disputes.  

3- Joseph Jacobson (MIT Media Lab): Founder of E Ink Corporation, Gen9, Inc., and Kovio, and a professor at MIT, known for inventing E Ink technology.  

4- Joe Jacobsen (Jacobsen Holz Corp.): President, Founder, and CEO of this company.  

PS this is the important part. Joseph Jacobson (MIT Media Lab):  Gen9, Inc., and a professor at MIT, known for inventing E Ink technology.   MIT Media Lab received and obligated amount for for 2 million dollars from NASA in which 1.5 already dispersed and still 6 month left into this project.  

 Also, Gen9, Inc., received 1.36 millions between 2014 and 2016 from the Department of Commerce (DOC).   He started his PAC based on his direct benefits of gov contracts and Tax payers fundings.

The below video is been advertised on social media and @RepSwalwell reshared it to amplify it. 
Here's my findings. Progress Action Fund (PAF) PAC was founded and lead by Joe Jacobson in August 2020  a former Obama administration alum. It focuses on producing and running hard-hitting advertisements to defeat Republican candidates in swing districts and support liberal Democrats in competitive "red to blue" races. PAF is known for its aggressive, viral ad campaigns, such as “Keep Republicans Out Of Your Bedroom” and “Republicans Watching Your Daughter,” which aim to hold Republicans accountable and shape political narratives.

National Security Emergency: 
Shocking Conflict at MP Materials! 
MP Materials, tied to China's state-backed Shenghe Resources (8% stake), is cashing in on U.S. government contracts despite clear ties to the CCP. Shenghe buys rare earths from MP’s Mountain Pass Mine for processing in China, while the DOD and DOE funnel millions to MP, including:  
 $35M contract (2/17/2022)  

 $8.3M contract (8/31/2023)

This directly violates CFIUS policies banning U.S. business with CCP-linked firms. It’s a national security red flag, and accountability is needed NOW!  #HoldThemAccountable

Why does China own stake in USA REE Mine in California? This must Change @realDonaldTrump @JDVance @SecRubio @SecScottBessent @DavidSacks @DefiyantlyFree @ChinaUncensored @committeeonccp @ChrisHarrisADG @StealthMedical1 @GrantCardone @TVMohandasPai @MargoinWNC @WhiteHouse 

The Mountain Pass Mine in California, owned by MP Materials, is the only significant rare earth element (REE) mine in the United States. It produces about 15% of the world’s REEs, extracting minerals like neodymium, cerium, and lanthanum from bastnäsite ore. 

Historically, due to the lack of domestic processing facilities, the mine has shipped its rare earth concentrate to China for further processing, particularly to refiners like Shenghe Resources, a Chinese company that also holds a stake in MP Materials. This arrangement stems from China’s dominance in REE processing, handling nearly 90% of global supply, while the U.S. has limited capacity for separating and refining these elements.

Since 2017, MP Materials has been working to restore domestic processing capabilities. As of 2023, the company began separating light REEs at Mountain Pass, with plans to process neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide and, with Department of Defense funding, heavy REEs like dysprosium and terbium. 

However, full domestic processing without Chinese involvement has faced delays, and some concentrate is still sent to China. The mine’s operations are seen as critical for reducing U.S. reliance on Chinese supply chains, especially for defense and clean energy technologies, but challenges like environmental regulations and high processing costs persist. @grok verify this.

Afghanistan: 
 @TPASarah stated approximately $3.5 billion allocated for Afghanistan is managed by State Department officials in Switzerland. The specific statement was: "As I’ve mentioned before, $3.5 billion was discreetly transferred to Switzerland, where it’s now overseen by two Afghan representatives, a State Department official, and a Swiss government entity. We were told this fund could be accessed by the Taliban to cover expenses, such as issuing passports."

I may have uncovered where this money is being channeled—potentially through companies like Koenig & Bauer Banknote Solutions and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd., both based in Allschwil, Switzerland. From 2022 to the present, over $20 billion has reportedly been directed to Switzerland. Here’s a breakdown of the allocations by agency: 
The key questions are why the State Department funneled $10.7 billion to Switzerland, why the Department of Defense (DOD) spent over $800 million, and, most strikingly, why USAID allocated more than $8 billion there. Switzerland is not a developing nation, so what justifies these massive transfers?
@TPASarah I think the money is more than you estimated

Breaking : @NUKULYUS. Israel confirmed that over 200 aircraft were involved, launching 330 munitions targeting Iran. The operation focused on IRGC leaders, senior officials in Iran's nuclear program, and military leadership. Israeli Intelligence revealed Iran's advanced efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, noting they were nearing success. The IDF spokesperson stated that months of intelligence work enabled precise strikes on key targets across Iran to ensure Israel's security.
I have to ask now how good the Iranian radars and air defense systems?

TreePeople, Inc., a prominent California-based nonprofit, has received approximately $11 million in government funding. This includes an ongoing $8 million grant, active from April 2024 and extending through 2029. To promote fiscal responsibility, government funding for NGOs like TreePeople Should be discontinued, as these organizations have the capacity to sustain themselves independently. Additionally, consideration should be given to requiring such nonprofits to contribute taxes, aligning with broader tax equity principles.

Thread Today, I received a tip from a close associate whom I first met while working at the FBI Terrorist Screening Center in Vienna, Virginia, where she served as a contractor. Following that role, she secured another contract position with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Maryland. Most recently, she was employed by Celestar Corporation.

According to her, Celestar Corporation accused her of harassment—an allegation that appears to lack substantive basis or identifiable complainants. She also noted that Celestar Corporation presents itself as a small, veteran-owned business, yet it operates two subsidiary companies under a parent entity known as Celestar Holdings Corporation.

Colorado:
Maybe If Colorado spend less money on LGBTQ BS will have a better budget? 
Here's one program. Denver Health Hospital Authority (DHHA) is a 555-bed acute-care hospital with Level 1 adult and Level 2 pediatric trauma centers. It serves as the Region 8 Regional Emerging Special Pathogens Treatment Center (RESPTC) with a Biocontainment Unit (BCU) established in 2015, featuring two critical care beds, a high-risk pathogen lab, and 70 airborne isolation rooms. The High-Risk Infection Team (HITEAM) conducts multidisciplinary training every six weeks, including donning/doffing PPE, quarterly drills, and didactic series. DHHA also houses specialized centers for eating disorders, psychiatric care, addiction medicine, and LGBTQ+ care, along with 19 federal health centers, 12 school-based clinics, and the Denver 911 system. Located near Denver International Airport and military bases, DHHA collaborates with NETEC to maintain RESPTC standards and supports regional healthcare training.
The total money wasted on programs included LGBTQ was 35 million in the past 4 years.

My thoughts are with the people of Los Angeles. History will remember Trump as a wannabe authoritarian who was willing to sacrifice the safety of his fellow Americans in order to try to score cheap political points. This is not how a strong leader responds to protest -- it's what a weak, insecure man does.

The DOJ allocated $47 million for analyzing terrorist explosive devices, yet the DNC/RNC pipe bomber remains at large. Questions arise about the effectiveness of this contract, given the DOJ's inability to apprehend the suspect. What insights into terrorist devices has the DOJ gained from this investment, especially when the DNC/RNC pipe bomber case remains unsolved?

U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) Funding and Operations in Afghanistan: Recent Developments:

The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) allocated fake $40,000 to a counter-narcotics program in Afghanistan, the world's leading opium producer. This amount seems negligible for tackling such a massive issue, raising questions about its effectiveness. Was this funding merely a cover for intelligence operations, which typically aren't logged in federal spending records? 
Or they Just paid a local podcaster to make failed videos that no one watches?

FYI this Program still active till the end if Jun 2025

$59.9 million USAID Taliban Funding: 
On October 1, 2024, USAID allocated $59.9 million for technical services under the Women and Men in Agriculture (WAMA) Activity for its Afghanistan Mission, as outlined in Section C of the contract. The contract was marked complete in February 2025, but only $15.8 million was disbursed. What happened to the remaining funds?

I’m raising this question because @TPASarah is conducting link analysis on the Taliban and Al-Qaeda movements within Afghanistan.

Additionally, I’d like an update on the status of the remaining funds allocated for contracts in Afghanistan. Specifically, what happened to the de-obligated amounts or funds from contracts terminated for convenience? Where did that money go?

DOD RFID Tags and failed audits. 
The Department of Defense (DoD) has invested over $160 million in RFID tags, yet it hasn't passed an audit in over a decade. If the DoD can't effectively track its assets with RFID technology, what's the point of the expenditure? Given the government's enthusiasm for using RFID to monitor equipment, can it track the weapons left behind for the Taliban? Here are some examples below: 
FYI: If I use different search terms i will pull more money the number in the billions invested in RFID's

DOD RFID Tags and failed audits. 
The Department of Defense (DoD) has invested over $160 million in RFID tags, yet it hasn't passed an audit in over a decade. If the DoD can't effectively track its assets with RFID technology, what's the point of the expenditure? Given the government's enthusiasm for using RFID to monitor equipment, can it track the weapons left behind for the Taliban? Here are some examples below: 
FYI: If I use different search terms i will pull more money the number in the billions invested in RFID's 

H/T to @kparrish51 for bringing this to my attention.

**Content**:
```
Senator Graham stated "This isn’t a travel expense report. It’s a monthly contract between the State Department for U.S. diplomats in a war zone — nothing to do with my trip." 
The hotel expenses for June 2025 total $814,806, comprising $411,634 and $403,172. 
A comparison with prior months shows May 2025 expenses at $396,154 and $387,950, totaling $784,104; April 2025 had no reported expenses; and March 2025 expenses were $597,740 and $6,776, totaling $604,516.

Why have hotel expenses been lower in previous months? Are Senator Lindsey Graham's hotel costs included in the Department of State's monthly expenses, or has the U.S. increased its personnel presence in Ukraine? Either scenario raises concerns.

**Content**:
```
You may want to look into his company.  Mike Pompeo, Brian Bulatao, Ulrich Brechbuhl, or Michael Stradinger—the West Point classmates who co-founded Thayer Aerospace (later Nex-Tech Aerospace)—some of these individuals, particularly Pompeo and Bulatao, later held roles in government that involved significant interaction with the intelligence community, which has fueled speculation about earlier connections. Keep in mind State&CIA are interchangeable 

Mike Pompeo
Background: A 1986 West Point graduate, Pompeo served as a cavalry officer in the U.S. Army until 1991, including patrols along the Iron Curtain. He attended Harvard Law, worked as a lawyer before co-founding Thayer Aerospace.

Pompeo served as Director of the CIA (2017–2018) he was Secretary of State (2018–2021), 
•Speculation:  His rapid rise in politics and Koch Industries’ investment in Thayer as circumstantial evidence.
•Koch Connection: Thayer Aerospace received significant funding from Koch Industries, a conglomerate with ties to libertarian and conservative political networks. Some speculative narratives allege Koch-funded ventures indirectly intersect with intelligence interests due to their political influence.

Brian Bulatao
•Background: A West Point classmate of Pompeo’s, Bulatao co-founded Thayer Aerospace and served as its chief operating officer. He later joined Pompeo in founding Sentry International, an oilfield equipment company, in 1998. Pompeo and big oil and Ukraine/Russia. !!!
•Bulatao served as Under Secretary of State for Management (2018–2021) under Pompeo, a role involving oversight of State Department operations, including security and coordination with intelligence agencies (CIA belly button). He was also briefly the Chief Operating Officer of the CIA during Pompeo’s tenure as director which is the gatekeeping #3 job, a position directly tied to the agency’s operational management.

Ulrich Brechbuhl
•Background: Another West Point classmate, Brechbuhl co-founded Thayer Aerospace but left the company early to pursue other ventures. He later worked as a lawyer and executive, including at Bank of America. Notorious for money laundering CIA operations. 
•Later Intelligence Ties: Brechbuhl served as Counselor of the State Department (2018–2021) under Pompeo, a senior advisory role that involves strategic and diplomatic issues, including coordination with intelligence agencies. During his tenure, he was involved in controversial actions, such as accompanying Pompeo to Ukraine in 2019 amid the Trump impeachment inquiry, which drew scrutiny for potential intelligence-related implications. Again, Ukraine. 

Michael Stradinger
•Background: The least publicly documented of the four, Stradinger was a West Point classmate who co-founded Thayer Aerospace but left early. Little is known about his subsequent career, as he has maintained a low public profile.

As promised, here’s the list of Lindsey Graham’s travel expenses over the years. Note that most trips are recorded as Department of State hotel expenses without specific details. By cross-referencing, you can deduce that when politicians travel, the State Department logs the expenses. If you know of any representative or senator traveling outside the United States, let me know, and I’ll track the associated costs.

There is more I will be releasing at the appropriate time when the time comes. Stay Tuned.
Also If your congress member/ senator flying overseas let me know and i will find the trip cost.

While Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal strut through Kyiv, Ukraine, jaw-dropping State Department records have just dropped on USA Spending, revealing their extravagant hotel expenses. On June 1, 2025, two staggering transactions surfaced: one for a mind-blowing $403,172 and another for an eye-popping $411,634. 
The question on everyone’s mind—what justifies this astronomical spending any why this much?

Raquel Debono, known as #raqisright on Instagram, has been featured by reputable outlets such as the New York Post @nypost.  
While Ms. Debono’s visibility has increased, it appears that the original creator of the "Make America Hot Again" campaign has not been properly credited. 
The New York Post previously reported on the individual who pioneered this concept, yet recent coverage seems to overlook this fact in favor of promoting Ms. Debono. 
 
As a result, Ms. Debono is benefiting from online sales tied to a campaign she did not originate. I respectfully urge your publication to clarify the attribution of this concept to its rightful creator and ensure accurate representation in future coverage.

On April 14 the Daily Caller covered the story on how three young beautiful conservatives @jaymefranklin16 @isabelledwyerr @carolinedowney_,  ladies started this movement coordinating parties for young conservatives in NYC. However, @nypost, covered the story back in August 7 2022. Jayme Franklin even had @LaraLeaTrump do modeling shoots for her. Now the movement is being hijacked by Raquel Debono.

Thread: Make America Hot Again Movement:  
Like So many other movement this one is getting hijacked by Raquel Debono and getting prompted by the big conservative media.   

On April 14 the Daily Caller covered the story on how three young beautiful conservatives @jaymefranklin16 @isabelledwyerr @carolinedowney_,  ladies started this movement coordinating parties for young conservatives in NYC. However, @nypost, covered the story back in August 7 2022. Jayme Franklin even had @LaraLeaTrump do modeling shoots for her. Now the movement is being hijacked by Raquel Debono. See part two below for more on who Raquel Debono is

Raquel Debono, known as #raqisright on Instagram, has been featured by reputable outlets such as the New York Post @nypost.  
While Ms. Debono’s visibility has increased, it appears that the original creator of the "Make America Hot Again" campaign has not been properly credited. 
The New York Post previously reported on the individual who pioneered this concept, yet recent coverage seems to overlook this fact in favor of promoting Ms. Debono. 
 
As a result, Ms. Debono is benefiting from online sales tied to a campaign she did not originate. I respectfully urge your publication to clarify the attribution of this concept to its rightful creator and ensure accurate representation in future coverage.

4 Parts Thread: How USAID redirected $95,490,240 from Tunisia to Yemen then Gaza, and the West Bank, initiating the process in 2018 with final approval and signing on January 18, 2025.

How did this whole thing started?
In 08/15/2018 USAID approved $95,490,240 in Tunisia for "The purpose of GISR MENA is to sustainably strengthen local, national, and regional systems to adapt to shocks and stressors in the MENA region." GISR stands for (Governance Integration for Stabilization and Resilience).  The performance period was supposed to be from  08/15/2018 to 08/14/2023.

As you can see below from the original contract spending.

Tylenol Steady:
Between 2022 and 2024, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided a $150,000 grant to the University of North Texas to study the effects of Tylenol use during pregnancy and its potential link to autism. Share this with anyone dismissing the concerns raised by RFK Jr. and Donald Trump.

The steady concluded "About 65% of pregnant women in the US use acetaminophen (Tylenol in the US, paracetamol in Europe). Despite concerns about its safety during pregnancy, including risks of liver damage, developmental issues, and conditions like autism or hyperkinetic disorders, it is widely used and endorsed by US doctors and the FDA. While some medications taken during pregnancy, like diethylstilbestrol (DES), are known to increase cancer risk in children, the potential cancer risk from acetaminophen is not well-studied. This study will use Taiwan’s national health databases, including maternal and child health records and cancer registries, to investigate whether acetaminophen use during pregnancy is linked to childhood cancer. The goal is to provide better evidence on its safety to guide regulatory decisions."

Small Business Administration (SBA) Bailout for Modeling Agency 
While many small businesses were devastated by COVID, facing closures and denied SBA loans, the SBA provided bailouts to a New York modeling agency for $110,789.97 and OnlyFans, which I posted about a few days ago.

Department of State Pride Month Spending in Guyana.

In 2021, the U.S. State Department spent $23,520 on waterproof lighting for the U.S. Embassy fence to commemorate Pride Month, from June 1 to June 30, 2021.

In the obscure reaches of South America lies the Republic of Guyana, a nation so elusive it evades the gaze of even the most seasoned cartographers. Yet, in a bold and defiant act, the U.S. State Department adorned its embassy fence there with vibrant Pride Month regalia, thrusting this hidden gem into the spotlight of global celebration.

The company based in Iraq who received the money.  GOLDEN HANDS PRIVATE COMPANY FOR TRADING & GENERAL CONTRACTING, LTD. Located in AL-HURYAH 50 MT ST BLDG 8 BAGHDAD, IRAQ. With No history of contracting with the U.S. Gov except this contract we need to ask questions here. 
P.S. Al- Huryah district is just outside of Al Kadhimiya and its heavy Shia 'at dominated district. 
DOD hiring an Iraqi company that was established in Aug 2021 to only preform one contract starting in 2024 in Iran sound pretty shady.

In an astonishing display of extravagance, the Department of Defense squandered a jaw-dropping $661,936 on a single garage door in Portsmouth, VA, grandly dubbed the A26/28 Main Large Door.

Understanding Top Secret Information and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).

Many individuals claim to hold Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearances and possess exclusive knowledge. However, most do not have access to the full scope of classified information. The purpose of SCI, "REL TO" designations, and other classification protocols is to restrict information on a need-to-know basis, compartmentalizing access to protect sensitive data. For further details, refer to ICD 704 or Intelligence Community Standards (ICS) 705-1 and 705-2.

As a former intelligence officer and analyst with the highest-level government security clearance, I still lacked access to all classified information, as access is strictly limited to what is necessary for one’s role.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is funding a pilot program to address fake PTSD among unaccompanied migrant teens. On May 9, 2023, HHS awarded a $1.4 million grant to The Trustees of Columbia University in New York City.
A prior study (CAMINANDO) with 74 Latino teens in NYC showed that exposure to violence and hunger correlated with poorer mental health and cognitive outcomes, but strong social networks post-resettlement aided coping. A new 18-month study (CAMINANDO-MENTAL HEALTH) with 400 teens is proposed to further explore and address these issues.

Another word B.S spending...

This program still ongoing.

Long Thread Who's behind Antifa. Meet itsgoingdown org
First what's antifa?
A Communist and Anarchist Movement Openly Supporting Violence
Antifa, a revolutionary Marxist and anarchist militia, aims to dismantle the United States through violence and intimidation. According to a September 2017 report in The Atlantic, Antifa has fueled a level of continuous political street conflict unmatched in the U.S. since the 1960s.  Short for “antifascist,” Antifa is often associated with the red-and-black flag of anarcho-communism. The Antifa-affiliated website http://ItsGoingDown.org explains that in the U.S., most activists are anarchists, with some identifying as Maoist or anti-state Marxists, while globally, the movement leans heavily Marxist. U.S.-based Antifa anarchists reject capitalism and government institutions, openly promoting violence to destabilize and eliminate both. Their ultimate goal is to establish a global communist order.

This week, DOGE shut down a foreign aid agency called Millenium Challenge Corporation. 

Thanks to @awsalebadi for finding contracts. See  his for strange expenses from MCC, starting with a $746,293.66 for a Gender and Social Inclusion Director. 

Millennium Challenge Corporation is heavily USGLC-linked, with a dedicated section on USGLC. They had a section dedicated to it, but it's been removed. 

If you don't know what USGLC is - see my pinned thread.

An obscure government agency unfamiliar to most. Read the last part of the thread that relates to Canada. 
Have you ever stumbled across the shadowy MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION? Most haven’t—it’s a clandestine government agency cloaked in the deceptive guise of a corporate name, lurking in the depths of bureaucratic obscurity.

Let’s shine a light on their reckless spending. On April 22, 2025, they quietly renewed a jaw-dropping $746,293.66 contract—originally inked on February 12, 2023—with MARIA BEATRIZ ORLANDO, their Gender and Social Inclusion Director. This full-time personal services contract, shrouded in secrecy, is set to bleed taxpayer dollars until February 11, 2026. 

What’s really going on behind the veil of this enigmatic agency?

The Shocking Walt Disney-U.S. Army Scandal: Shades of Green Program at Walt Disney World Resort
In a jaw-dropping revelation, the U.S. Army has funneled millions of taxpayer dollars into a shadowy program known as Shades of Green at Walt Disney World Resort. 

At the peak of the 2021 government shutdown, when the nation was paralyzed and the resort stood eerily silent, the Army brazenly poured $1,947,543.73 into this enigmatic initiative. But the plot thickens—on June 15, 2020, the FBI quietly diverted $49,091.00 to the same cause. 

For years, this clandestine program has siphoned off vast sums of public funds, leaving a trail of questions and a haunting truth: millions spent, with nothing to show for it.

Brace yourself: the Department of Health and Human Services unleashed a staggering $107.5 million on a single contract with Retractable Technologies Inc. in Maryland, all to secure 1ml syringes paired with 25G x 1" needles for the COVID-19 fight, spanning February 2021 to February 2022. This is but one deal in a web of contracts! Consider this: each needle costs a mere $0.08–$0.20, yet Maryland, with its 6,180,253 souls in 2023 per the US Census Bureau, bore witness to this colossal expenditure. What secrets lie in the shadows of such a monumental investment?

I'm not a math expert. However, someone please do the math here on how many shots on an average everyone took in MD based on the numbers.

 And as if that wasn’t enough, they scored another $20,436,922 just 12 days later on April 15, 2025! That’s right—$135 MILLION+ in taxpayer dollars flowing straight to THE ARMORED GROUP LLC for their luxe Mercedes-Benz armored beasts. What’s the real cost of this high-roller spending spree?

U.S. Rep Cory Mills.
U.S. Representative Cory Mills (R-FL) is married to Rana Al Saadi, an Iraqi- American with a background in national security. The couple married in 2014 in a ceremony officiated by an Islamic imam at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Centre in Virginia, which has drawn controversy due to the imam's alleged ties to radical groups. Mills and Al Saadi co-founded PACEM Solutions International LLC, a defense and security firm, in 2014, and they have two children together. Recent reports indicate Mills was separated from Al Saadi by late 2021 and claimed to an ex-girlfriend that their divorce was finalized in 2024, though as of September 2025, public records and statements still describe him as married.

U.S. Rep Cory Mills.
U.S. Representative Cory Mills (R-FL) is married to Rana Al Saadi, an Iraqi- American with a background in national security. The couple married in 2014 in a ceremony officiated by an Islamic imam at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Centre in Virginia, which has drawn controversy due to the imam's alleged ties to radical groups. Mills and Al Saadi co-founded PACEM Solutions International LLC, a defense and security firm, in 2014, and they have two children together. Recent reports indicate Mills was separated from Al Saadi by late 2021 and claimed to an ex-girlfriend that their divorce was finalized in 2024, though as of September 2025, public records and statements still describe him as married.

LTG. Flynn Story Time
Most people know LTG Michael Flynn from the FBI ambush during the first Trump Administration, but few are aware of his critical role in stabilizing Iraq in 2008. From 2007 to 2008, I served in Basra, Iraq, with ODA 5332, 5th Special Forces Group, helping establish the 6th Iraqi Special Operations Battalion to operate in southern Iraq.

During this period, LTG John F. Mulholland Jr. (Special Forces) took command of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) following a major restructuring in CENTCOM’s area of responsibility. MG Flynn then, who served as Director of Intelligence for the Joint Special Operations Command from July 2004 to June 2007, then became Director of Intelligence for U.S. Central Command from June 2007 to July 2008. He provided strategic guidance to LTG Mulholland on counterinsurgency tactics, overcoming the repeated setbacks under GEN Casey.

By May 2008, we executed the pivotal operation "Charge of the Knights," which effectively dismantled insurgency activities in the region until policy shifts under the Obama Administration in 2010 destabilized Iraq and the broader region by 2011. LTG Flynn’s deep expertise in global threats and unwavering dedication to America are often overlooked. He is a true patriot and hero.

What it is Means to Face Death Face to Face?
Below an example of what that means. 
What you see here that we got a tip from the kids in town that this house belongs to terrorists. 
The person you see going over the gate is me. 

FYI this is the side gate this house was a corner house and had three entrees.

We inspected all the walls and the all had glass shrapnels to prevent people from jumping over 

I took a risk, when I jumped over one of the side gates as I suspected there doors was booby trapped  with grenades. later after going over the house almost every wall was booby trapped with 155 ml artillery shells. Thanks to the kids who gave us the tip. 
PS that day we waited for EOD for 9 hours to show up to blow up the house.

Part 3: Exclusive Report Where Are the Kids?
HHS 75 Billion dollars funding for Southwest Key Programs Inc.

@RyanMattaMedia gave me the name of this NGO They’re a nonprofit claiming running “shelters, education, housing, medical care  and reunification” for unaccompanied minors, funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ ORR, I found some funding receipts.   

Questions needs to be asked here:
1- Reuniting kids with WHO? Cartels? 
2- @MarioNawfal EXPOSED their crumbling shelters with proving reports and investigation of budlings lacking on basic services like showers and kitchens! 
3- Faking kid counts to STEAL taxpayer cash? 
4- Which government crooks are in on it?  

Since 2008, they’ve looted BILLIONS, allegedly under Obama’s orders, with Mayorkas plotting to CRASH America in a flood of illegals. And bring America to her Knees!  I found some receipts and it tracks with what Ryan investigate and it go's back all the way to 2008.

Below you will see one example of a recent grant for 75 Billion dollars. Another one for 22 millions for shelter and transportation services! 

PS the 75 Million Dollars contract still active till 2028.

Exclusive Report Where Are the Kids?
 MVM Inc. DHS Funding. 

Following a tip from Ryan Matta, an independent journalist focused on NGOs and human trafficking, I investigated MVM Inc.’s government contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On March 31, 2020, MVM Inc. received $743,584,952.88 for Unaccompanied Alien Children and Family Units Transportation Services, later increased to $826,807,087.25. The contract was terminated on April 8, 2025.

The expenditure of over $826 million for transporting vulnerable populations raises serious concerns about oversight. Where are these kids? 

For transparency, the officials linked to this funding are Beth Davis (BETH.DAVIS@ICE.DHS.GOV), Pamela Odhiambo (PAMELA.ODHIAMBO@ICE.DHS.GOV), and JCapello7012. Given the implications for children, I felt it necessary to share the name and emails of those who been involved. Below is the receipts. 

Ps Over the years MVM Inc received over 3 billion dollars and spiked during the Biden admin. Below is the funding trends as well.

Exclusive Bailouts for Delayed contracts 
So check this out. If you're hired for a gig and fall behind, guess what? Taxpayers shouldn't have to foot the bill for your flop! On April 9, 2025, the U.S. Marshals Service shelled out an extra $1,949,487.52 to Johnson Controls Security Solutions LLC for a project already stuck in the mud. Why are hardworking taxpayers stuck paying for someone else's screw-ups?

Exclusive: John Cornyn Mexico Visit 2023
In March 2023, Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) led a bipartisan congressional group to Mexico City, meeting with President López Obrador and officials to tackle U.S.-Mexico security and economic issues.

The delegation, including senators and representatives, focused on cartel violence, fentanyl trafficking, and immigration. 

Cornyn urged Mexico to arrest drug lords and allow their extradition, stressing the need for cooperation to maintain safety and prosperity along the shared border.

Thread 
@DataRepublican did a massive thread on The 2025 May Day trip of SLC Armed Queers to Cuba: "Well, if we're terrorists, we're proud to be terrorists" And how the Obama Admin funded that. This extended beyond Obama throughout the years through the state department.   
Here's some gov funding for these so called cultural efforts. 
1- Government funding supports bilingual and cultural programs at the embassy, offering English language instruction and leadership training to at-risk Cuban undergraduate students, alongside lessons introducing them to U.S. culture, history, and values.

2-A one-week cultural exchange program featuring musician, singer, and songwriter Robert Glasper, a seven-time Grammy winner who received the 2023 Grammy for Best R&B Album, combining entrepreneurship training with cultural engagement.

Exclusive Look Into Linguistic Contracting Companies
The following is a comparison of U.S. government spending on American Sign Language (ASL) services versus two linguistic contracting companies. 

The first image shows the government's expenditure on ASL services dating back to 2008. The second image displays the spending on VALIANT INTEGRATED SERVICES LLC, which exceeds $5 billion.

 The third and fourth images present another linguistic company, Global Linguist Solutions LLC, with an amount surpassing $2.1 billion.

Note that the U.S. military and government employ a diverse workforce, including many foreign language-speaking service members. In the military, individuals who speak qualifying languages receive an additional $500 per month for each language. 

Government employees can also receive this amount, but only if their position is designated as language-enabled. For instance, despite working for the Army CI Command with a 3/3 DLPT score in Arabic and using my language skills for OSINT analysis, I was denied the extra pay because my billet was not classified as language-enabled. But the command hirs linguists to do just what i was doing. Complete waste of taxpayers money...   

PS This example of only 2 companies and dose not include Leidos, Booze Allen and many others.

Providing an example of a legitimate government contract. 
While my typical focus is on uncovering instances of fraudulent government spending, I can highlight a contract that appears to be a worthwhile investment. This contract pertains to American Sign Language (ASL) services, spanning from 2017 to 2023, with a total value of $8.1 million. 

This amount is actually peanuts giving the fact I started my career as an Arabic linguist and i know a lot about these type of contracts.

ScoopNationwide Tesla/ Gov Protest April 5th
Indivisible has scheduled another Tesla protest, set to take place in Hollywood, Florida.
I received an anonymous tip indicating that Lauren Donsky-Levine, identified as a reservist FEMA employee, is involved in organizing the event through Facebook. Supporting materials, including pictures and flyers, are provided below.
Additionally, it appears that Army Brigadier General Curt Alan Rauhut, who reportedly liked her post, is currently serving as a commander with the United Nations, according to his public profile.

 MAJOR BREAKING: State Department & UN ties to Armed Queers SLC leader now confirmed 

First, credit to @SKDoubleDub33 for the crucial tip, PLEASE follow, they'll be doing a podcast on this soon.

Here’s what you need to know:

 Armed Queers SLC is under investigation for possible foreknowledge of Charlie Kirk’s assassination.

 Their leader, Ermiya Fanaeian, was recognized by a State Dept–affiliated NGO, Utah Global Diplomacy, as a recipient of the "7 for 17" Award for advancing the UN's 17 Goals 

 Utah Global Diplomacy has since scrubbed Fanaeian's presence from their website. Unknown when this purge happened. The receipts remain.

Patience as I pull this thread together.

Thread Read All Parts Please. 
Election Night Analysis
The whole thing started with Tesla takedown. 
Let's examine the facts surrounding the recent election events in a clear and objective manner:

1- Brad Schimel's campaign struggled significantly until the final moments, receiving limited attention and support. The Republican National Committee (RNC) and several prominent Republican figures did not prioritize or effectively promote the campaign, resulting in minimal publicity.

2- Only a handful of influential MAGA-aligned accounts, such as @ScottPresler and @DataRepublican actively engaged in supporting this campaign. Many others focused primarily on sharing memes and casual posts to boost their own visibility, opting not to invest effort or resources into the campaign.

3- In the Florida races, Democratic candidates outspent their Republican counterparts by a ratio of 10 to 1, yet they still suffered double-digit losses.\

4- The Wisconsin Supreme Court maintained its existing 4-3 Democratic-leaning majority. While Republicans did not lose a seat, they were unable to      secure an additional one to shift the balance.

5- The passage of Voter ID legislation represents a positive development for election integrity.

6- From a strategic perspective, Democrats likely prioritized gaining two seats in Florida over securing the Wisconsin Supreme Court seat due to the fact they pumped in so much money that they out spent the republican 10 to 1.

HSS Spending Scam Discovered
I recently identified an instance where an individual at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is authorizing payments of $11,720 to individuals with registered home businesses. 
There are 34 such payments documented, with seven additional payments scheduled for release in the near future.
 Attached is an example of one such payment, along with details of the remaining seven recipients slated to receive these funds. Notably, I observed that all approvals appear to have been authorized by the same individual, as indicated in the top right corner of the first document.

Urgent Update: Exposing Judge Susan Crawford Wisconsin Election and her Roots 
Judge Susan Crawford once lent her talents to Pines Bach LLP, a firm that, upon my relentless investigation, I’ve uncovered as a cesspool of deceit. This so-called "small business" shamelessly forged documents to siphon exorbitant PPP loans during the COVID chaos—loans meant to cap at a modest $50,000 for legitimate operations. 

Yet, between 2020 and 2021, Pines Bach LLP gorged itself on ill-gotten gains, pocketing two staggering SBA payments: $475,879.30 and $466,793.08. 

They danced away unscathed, mocking justice itself. If your foundations are rooted in such a swamp of corruption, you have no business wielding a gavel from the bench.

Obama Media Psyop Funding 
As I mentioned last night, I promised to share this post this morning, and here it is. 
In 2010, the Obama Administration granted HILL & KNOWLTON STRATEGIES, LLC $1.2 million to support Phase #2 of President Obama’s "United We Serve" initiative. They later received an additional $705,000 for Phase #3. You can find the receipts below. 

This initiative kicked off in 2005, and the same company has been spearheading its strategy from the start. Interestingly, 2005 also marks the year Obama began rising to prominence. The Obama media psyop seems to have its roots back then.

But a stunning discovery reveals LinkedIn, Hoffman’s brainchild, received over $2.5 million in U.S. government funding and subscriptions as a startup. Below are the receipts: total funding and a sample contract. This bombshell casts doubt on Hoffman’s credibility—judge for yourself.

Exposing Rep. Hakeem Jeffries And USAID Kickbacks to the Democrats
On April 21, 2023, the State Department spent $16,398 on Hakeem Jeffries’ lodging in Ghana for a two-day visit. Reports suggest the trip aimed to boost U.S.-Ghana economic ties and enhance border and coastal shipping cooperation. 
"Hotel receipt below." 

Yet, a grim shadow looms. In April 2023, Ghana’s economy teetered as IMF bailout talks stumbled. X posts near April 25 flagged a stalled $3 billion deal due to missed meetings, with soaring inflation and debt fueling unease. Relief arrived in May, but April simmered with strain. 

Compounding the gloom, USAID poured $1.21 billion into Ghana from 2021 to late 2024, a stark contrast to the economic turmoil of April 2023, when IMF bailout delays deepened the nation’s inflation and debt struggles. 

Did the Dems force the IMF to bailout Ghana?

Senator Chris Murphy Foreign Travel
Earlier @pepesgrandma reported how Sen Murphy working with far left organizations like MoveOn and few others to overthrow the Serbian Gov. The Org's in Question they have operations all over the EU and south America. 

Below I was able to track Sen Murphy's few travel trips funded by tax payers dates all the back to 2011 that was paid by Tax payers to accomplish his deeds. Below are few examples.

1- Jul 28, 2023 Ireland $16,806 Local elections in northern Ireland 
2- Jul 27, 2022 Brazil $10,712 right before the Brazilian Election 
3- Sep 30, 2013 Russia $3,095 this tracks when Alexei Navalny was running for office in a gubernatorial race

PS There are other trips In Belgium, Sweden and France as well   

Looks like @ChrisMurphyCT been violating the logan Act since 2011

Let’s get past the parlor games and remember what happened with these leaked Signal chats. They disclosed classified information that could put lives at stake. Now, Secretary Hegseth needs to man up and admit his mistake -- or resign and stop being a distraction.

Child Exploitation Gov Spending Scam Overseas

Check this out I found few contracts clocked under child exploitation and protection and human trafficking. 
The catch is the amount of money spent is very low to even open and investigation overseas. 

Below some example of these scam spending
 
1- 06/12/2024 to 06/22/2024 $69,629.83 for (DHS) Advanced Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking in THAILAND. However, this money was actually for hotel and rental cars 
2- 01/02/2025 to 01/12/2025 $12,849.45 for (DHS/ICE)Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Investigations again its also for hotel rooms and nothing to do with investigation

3 parts How the DC Swamp is Undermining @DOGE  and Crushing the Will of We the People  
Last night, while digging into some research, I stumbled upon a chilling pattern: key contracts are vanishing from the government spending database. I found several cases, but one stands out as critical—it’s tied to Michael Hayden, ex-CIA director and one of the 51 intel officials behind the Hunter Biden laptop letter. Hayden sits on the board of Freedom Technology Solution Group LLC (FTSG), a company neck-deep in NSA tech contracts.

Urgent Update on Signal App Debacle and US Gov funding By US Agency for Global Media AKA VOA. 
The media loosing their mind and making this a bigger story than what it seems. What they failed to mention is Signal was government funded secure communication app and they have backdoor access to every text message. 
Signal originated from Whisper Systems, founded in 2010 by Moxie Marlinspike and Stuart Anderson. Their TextSecure and RedPhone apps, for encrypted texting and calls, merged into Signal by 2014 after Marlinspike formed Open Whisper Systems in 2013, post a Twitter acquisition in 2011. The Signal Protocol powers its respected end-to-end encryption.

Signal’s link to intelligence agencies stems from funding Open Whisper Systems got about $3 million from 2013 to 2016 from the Open Technology Fund (OTF), a U.S. government-backed group tied to Radio Free Asia (RFA). RFA, once CIA-funded in the 1950s, is now under the U.S. Agency for Global Media, supporting "internet freedom" tools for activists, aligning with U.S. policy.
Below you will see the total funding for OTF through out the years by USAGM and also some software contracts that allows the US gov to archive the cloud for WhatsApp and Signal. 
PS All congress members uses Signal for secure communication 
Please if you read this reshare it to get the truth out.

May 2020 COVID19 and election season started and we noticed Old Twitter start silencing decent and shifting the platform to far left hub 
In 2021 the US Gov start mandating the COVID19 Jab and silencing and all critics and promoting the Gov narrative and the far left and completely banning people accounts.

IOM Iraq operation. They received over 500 million dollars to process Iraqis applications to the U.S and the U.K who worked with coalition forces there as local national. Well there was a flaw in the process to start with IOM heired Kurdish, Arab's and Christians from the U.S and the UK to operate there. Two things happened.
1- These staffers started falsifying documents to bring their family members and friends 
2- These staffers started charging strangers 10k a pop through a third party connection to also falsify documents and bring people to the U.S and UK 
In both cases the falsification in the documents was making these applicants looks like they worked with coalition forces when in all reality they didn't. 
I personally know 4 Iraqi families they came here that way and they paid their way into the U.S and they reside in TN
below is the total funding for the Iraq operation

For your information, they also have an ongoing contract worth $25 million, again with DHS, set to run until 2026. So far, $9.8 million has been funded, and the contract could potentially increase to $36.4 million. Given this context, if you feel you were targeted due to your investigative work, I believe you might be onto something. These NGOs have clear motives to silence individuals like you who are working to expose their activities. Also there are more like these are still active...

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION "IOM" and they also go by OIM in South America
@DataRepublican shared a thread from @LarryTaunton Regarding Larry's swatting incident, he believes it may be linked to his extensive investigation into USAID and various NGOs. He specifically pointed out the International Organization for Migration (IOM, also known as OIM), which is one and the same NGO. Let's take a closer look at the total funding this NGO receives—nearly $10 billion from the U.S. government. In the second picture, you'll notice when the funding spike began. The third picture shows some of their contracts, which, by the way, span across the globe. The fourth picture provides an example of one such contract, detailing lodging and transportation for illegal migrants in Africa, funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

For your information, they also have an ongoing contract worth $25 million, again with DHS, set to run until 2026. So far, $9.8 million has been funded, and the contract could potentially increase to $36.4 million. Given this context, if you feel you were targeted due to your investigative work, I believe you might be onto something. These NGOs have clear motives to silence individuals like you who are working to expose their activities. Also there are more like these are still active...

IOM Iraq operation. They received over 500 million dollars to process Iraqis applications to the U.S and the U.K who worked with coalition forces there as local national. Well there was a flaw in the process to start with IOM heired Kurdish, Arab's and Christians from the U.S and the UK to operate there. Two things happened.
1- These staffers started falsifying documents to bring their family members and friends 
2- These staffers started charging strangers 10k a pop through a third party connection to also falsify documents and bring people to the U.S and UK 
In both cases the falsification in the documents was making these applicants looks like they worked with coalition forces when in all reality they didn't. 
I personally know 4 Iraqi families they came here that way and they paid their way into the U.S and they reside in TN
below is the total funding for the Iraq operation

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION "IOM" and they also go by OIM in South America
@DataRepublican shared a thread from @LarryTaunton Regarding Larry's swatting incident, he believes it may be linked to his extensive investigation into USAID and various NGOs. He specifically pointed out the International Organization for Migration (IOM, also known as OIM), which is one and the same NGO. Let's take a closer look at the total funding this NGO receives—nearly $10 billion from the U.S. government. In the second picture, you'll notice when the funding spike began. The third picture shows some of their contracts, which, by the way, span across the globe. The fourth picture provides an example of one such contract, detailing lodging and transportation for illegal migrants in Africa, funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Upon executing a search query with the terms "Wisconsin" and "Election," I retrieved results indicating that Amentum Services, Inc., a Virginia-based organization, is designated as providing "U.S. Seconded Personnel and Election Observers." At present, the linkage between this company and Wisconsin remains unclear from the data obtained, and I am unable to fully ascertain the basis for their involvement in this context. Additional research may be warranted to elucidate their role and relevance. I urge all interested parties to remain vigilant regarding these expenditures and activities. Should further clarification or assistance be needed to interpret these findings, I am available to provide support.
Additionally, The prison system is also making huge efforts into the mail in ballots historically so be on the lookout for that below is Amentum transaction and historical mail in ballots transaction for the prison system

Continuing the focus on South Africa, Since 2010 taxpayer-funded trips taken by Hunter Biden prior to his father's assumption of the presidency. This matter warrants attention as, in the absence of a presidential role, the expectation is that family members' travel expenses should be privately funded rather than supported by public resources. It should be noted that Secret Service protection, funded through the Department of Homeland Security, operates under a separate budgetary allocation, distinct from these travel costs.

@matt_vanswol and @brandinedgin  ask and you Shall receive
 Here's 174.2 Millions for Carbon steady for University of Oklahoma. from NASA 
NASA has chosen a unique Earth science mission called the Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory (GeoCarb) to study greenhouse gases and vegetation health from space. This mission will help us better understand how carbon moves between Earth's land, atmosphere, and oceans. GeoCarb will be launched on a commercial satellite and will orbit 22,000 miles above the equator, focusing on the Americas. 
The mission's main goals are to:
Monitor plant health and stress across the Americas

Study the natural sources and sinks of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane in the atmosphere

Improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle

GeoCarb will use a special instrument to measure sunlight reflected from Earth, which will help determine the amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. It will also measure a type of fluorescence from plants that gives information about photosynthesis. This mission was selected from 15 proposals submitted to NASA's Earth Venture program for small space-based studies of the Earth system.
132 million already spent we can claw back the rest. Also they need to be asked what they found so far. I bet you they have no answer

USIP Spending for fake Journalism
Are you familiar with an Agency called the United States Institute of Peace (USIP)? Yep Most people never heard of it 
It appears that this agency has largely remained under the public radar until recently. Upon conducting some research into their financial allocations, I discovered a contract among so many awarded to Eye Media Group on August 16, 2024, valued at $460,000. This contract, which is a continuation of prior agreements, pertains to the provision of Afghan journalist.
Additionally, I looked into Eye Media Group and they don't have a website and the linked in page is super vague
However, they have their own channel called Amu TV

DOJ Swatting Prevention Money Allocation in Oregon and Washington High-Schools
In Oct 01, 2023 The DOJ allocated $244,026 to Republic School District #309 in rural Ferry County, Washington, recently faced a swatting hoax—a false emergency report triggering a tactical police response and lockdown. Serving 400 K-12 students and 2,000 residents, the district in the state’s second-poorest county struggles with an outdated security system (two-day recording, no remote access, failing sensors) and delayed emergency response due to only four deputies covering 2,300 square miles. The district, a community hub hosting events and wildfire operations, seeks funding for modern cameras and a school resource officer to quickly resolve such incidents, enhance safety, and supplement limited law enforcement.
Also, on Oct 01, 2023 WINSTON DILLARD SCHOOL DISTRICT $426,701 for similar issue with swatting and other issues. 

Looks like Washington State and Oregon are breeding ground for these type of activities.  

PS this is not a wasteful spending I'm just highlighting the Issue with swatting and the recent incidents with many Influencers being swatted due to the political views they have.

Condoms for LATINX And other people of color
Check this out on Jul 01, 2021 the HHS awarded THE DAMIEN CENTER INC 1.76 million dollar for The Damien Center, a nonprofit in Indianapolis, proposes the Latinx Prevention Program to reduce HIV infections among Latinx MSM in Marion County, Indiana—one of 48 counties hardest hit by HIV per the CDC. The program will expand HIV testing, link more Latinx individuals to care (medical, ART, PrEP, and support services), and improve health equity. Short-term goals include increasing HIV status awareness, enhancing care access, boosting PrEP and condom availability, and improving cluster response. Long-term outcomes aim to lower new infections, improve health for those with HIV, reduce disparities, and decrease HIV-related deaths. 
There are few contracts like this are still in progress for the same exact amount. Below few examples in 4 different states

Thread In the memory of Iryna Zaruska:
Since the tragic killing of Iryna Zaruska by Decarlos Brown Jr., I’ve been reflecting deeply on the situation, choosing to remain silent until now. As the Political Adviser for the Ukraine Mission at SAG-U in Germany from 2023 to 2024, and with my former partner being Ukrainian, I was closely involved in the Ukraine operation. The harsh reality of crisis-driven immigration and migration, particularly through the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program, has been weighing on me. This program, which saw over 187,000 Ukrainians arrive in the U.S. by March 2024, distributed many to liberal cities under DHS guidance.
Earlier data reported 117,000 arrivals by February 2023 and 123,962 sponsorship requests with 50,832 arrivals by September 2022. The program was halted on January 28, 2025, and is no longer accepting new applications.

Chief Justice Roberts’ Family Family Drama: Wife’s Law Ties and Cousin’s Gay Rights Push
First I want to make it clear that Chief Justice Roberts has no ties to any NGO's directly. 
However, His Wife worked at  Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman
A noteworthy detail emerges from a 2013 statement by Jean Podrasky, who identified herself as the first cousin of John Roberts. In a guest commentary published by the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), a non-governmental organization dedicated to advancing LGBTQ+ rights, Podrasky referenced her familial connection to Roberts while expressing support for marriage equality. This statement was made in anticipation of Supreme Court cases addressing Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The commentary establishes a remote family link to an advocacy organization through Podrasky’s involvement, though it does not suggest that Roberts himself, or his immediate family—namely his wife or children—maintains any direct affiliation with the NCLR or comparable entities. 
"Source Is available on OSINT" 

PS  Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, a prominent law firm, has provided expert witness services in a limited number of cases associated with Supreme Court litigation. The firm, where John Roberts' wife was previously affiliated, contributed to these proceedings by supplying expert witnesses and offering legal drafting services to support the preparation of court documentation.

Below is just a simple example of how much they got paid to provide so called expert wittiness and paperwork preparation.

Popping the Budget: Government Splurges on Popcorn Extravaganza
Yes that's right you read the headline correctly. The US government Spent over 10 million dollars on popcorn and popcorn machines between 2021 and 2025 Here's some examples 
1- $111,145 on 04/25/2023 to SYSCO HAMPTON ROADS, INC for POPCORN, VARIETY.
2- $94,876 on 05/04/2023 to SYSCO HAMPTON ROADS, INC also POPCORN, VARIETY.  

PS I understand a good sum of those were going to military bases and I the search during COVID and most military MWR's were closed. 
Additionally, the SBA loans are very suspect as it sits for 9.5 million and again national science foundation 1.1 million

Photo Project On Israel/ Arab borderUSAID funded a photo project called "Photo Salam Activity," hiring Israeli photographer Eyal Landsman to lead it for 1.3 million dollars. 

The initiative seeks to foster greater coexistence by shifting public perceptions and attitudes toward diversity and a shared society. It will offer Arab and Jewish residents, including young adults and youth, a cooperative platform and photography skills training.

I wonder if they used the new skills to aide Hamas.

Climate Change Research ScamOn 01/29/2024 the NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER allocated $796,158.00 in which "100k already spent" to VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE & STATE UNIVERSITY to steady sea water rising level.  I dug deep into it and found an updated contract description the initial stated this "The interplay between land user decisions and landcover change in coastal ecosystems and working lands under sea level rise in the mid Atlantic US" on 03/04/2025 they updated the contract and put bunch of fancy language "screen shot captured below. Basically this steady will influence local lawmaker to change laws and force landowners to sale their land to developers.
FYI 695k can be cut immediately because only 100k was released so far.

Victor Pinchuk, Ukrainian oligarch behind the Victor Pinchuk Foundation (2006), and George Soros, Open Society Foundations founder, share goals in Ukraine—democracy, education, EU integration. Their foundations align through partners like the Open Society Institute and events like Pinchuk’s Yalta European Strategy (YES), where Soros spoke in 2014. Pinchuk, who calls Soros a mentor (2008 NYT), also joins him in networks like Brookings and the Clinton Global Initiative.

How's Victor Pinchuk indirectly connected to USAID and Open Society foundation. 
Pinchuk’s influence and his foundation’s focus on education and health suggest possible overlap with USAID-supported areas. Projects like “http://Zavtra.UA” or the Yalta European Strategy might have linked to USAID initiatives via partnerships or subcontracts, often through firms like Chemonics or direct grants to NGOs. Still, no solid proof—contracts, grants, or statements—shows USAID directly funding Pinchuk or his foundation.

Portland: 
In light of the recent incident involving the unlawful arrest of Nick Sortor and the ongoing targeting of conservatives who have been supporting ICE personnel, I felt it was important to review and evaluate the federal funding being directed to the City of Portland.

Here’s one example of a federally funded contract I found:

Expand MCL’s capacity to provide follow-up support for high-risk 988 callers.

Improve coordination among crisis stabilization, respite, and mobile crisis services.

Strengthen partnerships with law enforcement to reduce unnecessary police involvement.

Enhance collaboration between 911 and 988 to ensure timely mental health responses.

Increase engagement with high-risk groups, including people of color, individuals in substance use treatment, people experiencing homelessness, and LGBTQ+ individuals.

The overall funding for BS programs for the city of Portland is over 14 millions.

Slaughter In SyriaOn 8 December 2024, the Assad regime collapsed during a major offensive by opposition forces. The offensive was spearheaded by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and supported mainly by the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army as part of the ongoing Syrian civil war that began with the Syrian revolution in 2011.

That's the media narrative. 

Truth: Between 2013 and 2025 the USAID and State Department spent over 6 billion dollars supporting the Al Assad regime opposition through shell companies and left wing NGO's.

The craziest thing is that Climate United was only established on 09/20/2023 and received a 7 billion in April 2024. This is shady as it gets. Transaction registration below.

Law & launder On March 03, 2025 The American Bar Association wrote a hit piece on their website criticizing the current administration and defending the district judges who's been throwing bricks at Trumps executive orders to slow down the mandate that Trump received from the American people. 
We did a little deep dive on the ABA and we found the following. ABA received 33.6 million just in 2024 from the U.S. Gov in which 18.23 million came from USAID alone. In Just 2024 ABA allocated 10.2 million dollars to Ukraine those 10.2 million came from the USAID award. Below is the exact transaction trail.
PS The ABA started receiving an increased amount of funding from the U.S. GOV since the end of 2020.

I found entrees for Iran, but the spending is in Iraq based on the address and the location, but Iran was listed as the principal country. This is obviously a clerical entree error. this will cause confusion when people search for country-based spending. I hope y'all will get this database cleaned up.

Alert: Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Hollywood Connection. 
Kvartal 95, the Ukrainian entertainment company co-founded by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is primarily based in Kyiv. Their official site, http://kvartal95.com

Back in 2016, Zelenskyy told Prensario International that Kvartal 95 had agents working in Los Angeles and plans for a European agency, hinting at ambitions to expand westward. This aligns with their international push—think Servant of the People landing on Netflix and deals with Eccho Rights for global distribution. LA, being a hub for entertainment, makes sense as a touchpoint for such moves, but it’s more about representation than a physical HQ. Event listings, like a 2017 "Kvartal 95 New Show" at 4401 W 8th St, LA (from http://eventcartel.com), show they’ve performed there, likely tapping into the Ukrainian diaspora or comedy fans. These gigs don’t scream "relocation"—they’re one-offs, not a sign of moving operations.

Kvartal 95’s output includes movies like I, You, He, She (2018) and TV comedies like Svaty, with a focus on Russian- and Ukrainian-language content for broad appeal in the region. Before politics, Zelenskyy was its artistic director (2003-2011) and a key producer, leveraging partnerships with channels like 1+1, owned by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. Financially, it’s estimated to generate around $30 million annually, with Zelenskyy holding a 25% stake—valued at roughly $11 million by Forbes Ukraine in 2022—though he transferred his shares to partners like Serhiy Shefir upon entering office.

Who is Ihor Kolomoisky:
He is a Ukrainian oligarch, born February 13, 1963, in Dnipro (then Dnipropetrovsk), Soviet Ukraine. He’s a billionaire—Forbes pegged his net worth at $1 billion in 2021, down from $2.4 billion in 2014—known for wielding wealth, media, and political clout.

U.S. SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS SENT TO GERMANY—WHY?
Its the best way to avoid state and local taxes. Also, I believe because we have a lot of retirees and they live abroad to avoid federal taxes.

Bob Woodward: Journalism’s Shameless Profiteer.:

Bob Woodward, a U.S. Navy veteran who served as a lieutenant from 1965 to 1970, may be lauded for Watergate, but his career is a cesspool of ethical failures and brazen sensationalism. His addiction to insider access, hoarding bombshell scoops like Trump’s COVID-19 lies for book deals, and pushing discredited stories—like the fabricated Casey interview in Veil—lay bare a journalist driven by greed, not truth. Critics like Joan Didion scorn his bloated, gossip-soaked books as vacuous and directionless, propping up powerful sources while dodging systemic corruption. His tired, sycophantic formula and shaky accuracy shred his credibility. Most galling, Woodward bailed on a congressional delegation to the Security Assistant Group-Ukraine (SAGU-U) after forcing exhaustive preparations, showcasing his arrogant disregard for others.

Bob Woodward: Journalism’s Shameless Profiteer.:

Bob Woodward, a U.S. Navy veteran who served as a lieutenant from 1965 to 1970, may be lauded for Watergate, but his career is a cesspool of ethical failures and brazen sensationalism. His addiction to insider access, hoarding bombshell scoops like Trump’s COVID-19 lies for book deals, and pushing discredited stories—like the fabricated Casey interview in Veil—lay bare a journalist driven by greed, not truth. Critics like Joan Didion scorn his bloated, gossip-soaked books as vacuous and directionless, propping up powerful sources while dodging systemic corruption. His tired, sycophantic formula and shaky accuracy shred his credibility. Most galling, Woodward bailed on a congressional delegation to the Security Assistant Group-Ukraine (SAGU-U) after forcing exhaustive preparations, showcasing his arrogant disregard for others. Shockingly, the Dubuque Museum of Art still props him up, ignoring a legacy built on self-aggrandizement rather than integrity.

Who's Magdalena Maxwell.
Lida Maxwell’s scholarship focuses on progressive themes like social justice, environmental politics, and critiques of traditional power structures, which often align with left-leaning perspectives.
Basically, she's a far-left activist.

Additionally, I blocked the approver name on the top of the page because I don't want to Dox the person. Will leave that to the appropriate authorities to investigate.

**Content**:

Roadmap On How to Fix the Federal Government Staffing. Going forward the Trump Admin should;
1- Incentivize the Gov employees to exercise cost cutting instead of spending their yearly budget and request more for the next physical year "Oct 31" is the gov end of the Physical year for those who don't know And those cost cutting masseurs should be highlighted at their end of the year performance EVAL Specially for supervisors levels and up because they control the budget.
2- Any military personals O6 and above if they are 1 years from retirement they should not be allowed to write any justification for any GS/GG14 position and up. Because they are expanding their division and writing up and securing their next Job "It happens all the time".
3- There should be an honest survey about federal employees when they get asked if you are happy with your job or not then they should be able to answer the truth with out retaliation. This way you can sit down with the employee and figure out why they are not happy and maybe transfer them to a different mission where they can be more productive and serve the mission better.
4- The race and gender also Veteran status/ disability should be taken out from the hiring equation because no disrespect to anyone who served but there are a lot of veterans apply for jobs they are completely not qualified for and they get them because the point system we currently have for Vet preference "this will piss a lot of people off" I'm sorry but its the truth. Simple If you have the skills you get the job if you don't then you don't. 
5- Every new hire right out of college should be properly vetted and the clearance investigators should dig into their association with the college/ or universities groups. A lot of these kids are activist and they obtain TS/SCI and becomes Intel Analyst and Intel Officers. 
All the things I mentioned I have observed and seen when I was in the Federal Gov. There is more details to each step if the right folks take notice I can help. 

"If you see this please share and lets fix this thing".

Anti Semitic Al Hurra News Channel Fundings By 
UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR GLOBAL MEDIA AKA "Radio Free America"
Al Hurra News Channel was founded in Feb 2004. Alhurra's headquarters are in Springfield, Virginia. The network also maintains bureaus in Baghdad and Dubai, production centers in Beirut, Jerusalem, Cairo, Rabat, Erbil and Washington, D.C., as well as correspondents throughout the Middle East, North Africa, the United States and Europe.
In Sep 2004 The USAGM gave the first payment through of 48,500$ through OXFORD RESEARCH INT'L LTD. Then the payments kept flowing. The screen shoot bellow highlight the total transactions throughout the years. 
Also, pay attention to the language in the item description box.
P.S. I only searched by the exact name. Sometimes they put different spelling for reasons caused by human errors or something more nefarious.

Translation to this Hamas flyer below  

Inform those who to the patient, and who are struck by disaster and say, "Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return."

To my dear Gaza people. After the events that took place and the temporary ceasefire. And before starting to implementation of Trump’s cease-fire plan. Which will force your displacement what are you like it or not?
 Therefore, we have decided to address you with a final appeal to whomever  wants to assist us and we will not hesitate to assist in return. 

Reimagining the map of the world will not change. Even if all the people of Gaza disappeared. From existence, no one will feel you. No one will be happy about your value and your unity. In your inevitable fate, Iran cannot protect itself, let alone protect you. You have seen with your own eyes what happened to America and Europe. Gaza means nothing to them. Not even your Arabic allies countries who supply the oil, money and weapons but the send you coffins . There is little left to this game and it will be over 
Last but not least. Whomever wants to redeem himself before it’s too late. We are here before the end of times.

@StealthMedical1 @angertab @PeteHegseth @DNIGabbard @TulsiGabbard 

You need to get a hold on this asap

One of the biggest funders of Hochul backers is Haugland Energy Group three family members from the Haugland family donated $226,000. "this is just what was reported locally" 

Haugland Energy Group an energy company that received a contract with the gov for $46,971,894.64 for "ALTERNATE CARE FACILITY (ACF): WESTCHESTER COMMUNITY CENTER - WHITE PLAINS, NY" 
Why an energy company building a care facility on tax payers dime?

This contract was singed right before the rollout of the COVID 19 Vaccines and it was a 4 years obligation and the contract was closed in 11/12/2024.

 Alert: The Monster You Never Heard Of  "USAGM"
USAGM claims to broadcast truth, foster democracy, and promote freedom, but at its core, it serves as a tool for advancing U.S. foreign policy interests. Under the guise of providing "uncensored, unbiased news," it selectively reports to align with geopolitical strategies, often skewing narratives to fit political agendas.

What They Really Do:
Controlled Narratives: We operate in over 60 languages, but our content is carefully curated to influence public opinion in favor of U.S. interests, especially in regions of strategic importance.
Propaganda Portfolio: Including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks, and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, all strategically used to counter anti-U.S. sentiments.
Manipulation Through Technology: We use advanced tech not just to bypass censorship but to control the information flow, ensuring only narratives that support U.S. policy are amplified.
Real 'Achievements':
Digital Manipulation: Our digital expansion isn't just about reach; it's about crafting digital echo chambers where dissenting voices are marginalized.
Selective Journalism: Awards we receive are often for reporting that conveniently aligns with U.S. geopolitical goals, not necessarily for journalistic integrity.

@DOWResponse, One key reason for delays in federal projects is contract protests. When a company loses a contract during rebidding, they can file a protest, delaying the new company's start by 90 days. This doesn't help the protesting company regain the contract but allows them to continue receiving taxpayer funds for three more months. This practice must stop immediately. Below is one example of these contracts for $93.8 Million and potentially go up to $210.4 Million. Please comment and share. Thank you!

This doesn't help the protesting company regain the contract but allows them to continue receiving taxpayer funds for three more months. This practice must stop immediately. Below is one example of these contracts for $93.8 Million and potentially go up to $210.4 Million. Please comment and share. Thank you!

**Content**:

USAID funneled $53 million to EcoHealth Alliance, which then used U.S. taxpayer funds to support gain-of-function research on coronaviruses at the Wuhan lab—research that likely led to the creation of COVID-19.

The CIA’s deception regarding COVID-19 origins becomes much clearer when considering USAID's long history of serving as a CIA front organization.

With an annual budget exceeding $50 billion and activities in over 100 countries, USAID has repeatedly been linked to intelligence activities. Former USAID Director John Gilligan once admitted the agency was “infiltrated from top to bottom with CIA people,” explaining that “the idea was to plant operatives in every kind of activity we had overseas: government, volunteer, religious, every kind.”

In 2013, a U.S. cable published by WikiLeaks outlined the U.S. strategy to undermine Venezuela’s government through USAID by "penetrating Chavez’s political base," "dividing Chavismo," and "isolating Chavez internationally." 

In 2014, the Associated Press revealed that USAID funded the creation of a Twitter-like platform intended to incite a rebellion in Cuba.

USAID funding has been linked to coups in Haiti, Ukraine, Egypt, and other nations.

From 2009 to 2019, USAID partnered with EcoHealth Alliance on the PREDICT program, which identified 1,200 new viruses, trained 5,000 people globally in disease detection, and enhanced 60 research labs.

This partnership provided the CIA with a direct channel for embedding human assets within biological research facilities worldwide in exchange for funding and technology transfers.

In 2022, Dr. Andrew Huff, a former Vice President at EcoHealth Alliance, publicly revealed Dr. Peter Daszak’s alleged ties to the CIA.

The core issue? 

The CIA lied to the American public about COVID-19’s origins because acknowledging the truth would expose its likely role in funneling taxpayer money through USAID to finance gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab.

One million dead is a staggering loss of life and Americans were forced to pay for it by the hundreds of billions.

Washington’s sick obsession with funding the military industrial complex rather than seeking peace caused this tragedy.

I’m so glad I’ve never voted for this horrific war.

Albania: 
CDC's Influence on Global COVID Policies Through Funding and Partnerships.
I've recently discovered an organization closely linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that plays a key role in shaping health policies in other countries via financial support and grants. 
Allow me to introduce The Task Force for Global Health, Inc., a nonprofit based in Decatur, Georgia just a short distance from the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta. This proximity underscores the strong ties between the two entities, with The Task Force often partnering with the CDC on international initiatives, including vaccine distribution, disease surveillance, and public health strengthening in over 150 countries. 
A notable example is a CDC-funded grant channeled through The Task Force to support COVID-19 immunization and health system improvements in Albania. Valued at $54.8 million overall, the project has already disbursed $47.4 million, with the remainder still available for allocation as the initiative continues through 2026. This funding, part of broader CDC efforts to aid low- and middle-income nations like Albania in rolling out COVID-19 vaccines and building resilient public health infrastructure, highlights how U.S. resources indirectly influence global policy responses to the pandemic. 
Given the ongoing nature of the program, there may be opportunities to review or redirect the unspent funds to align with evolving priorities.

HHS Spending in HIV Testing for Transgender and LGBTQ+ Communities.
Did you know that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has allocated $2.43 billion for HIV testing targeting transgender and other LGBTQ+ groups from 2015 to the present, with 90% of the funds spent since 2021? Active grants, such as a $75.8 million initiative in New York City running from 2024 to 2029, focus on LGBTQIA+ individuals aged 13–29. The graph highlights that New York and California leading the pack.

GLOBAL RESETTLEMENT INITIATIVE:
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been exposed as a key player in a staggering financial web, funneled through Switzerland’s Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les Réfugiés. My earlier post hinted at a jaw-dropping $4 billion in funding following a Data Republican exposé on England’s refugee crisis. But brace yourself—the truth is far darker. A deeper dive reveals the UNHCR has raked in over $21 BILLION, with a grand total of $23.74 BILLION from the U.S. Department of State, $7.60 MILLION from USAID, and $5.22 MILLION from HHS. These colossal sums, flowing since 2008 and culminating in a chilling final payment on January 1, 2025, fuel the shadowy GLOBAL RESETTLEMENT INITIATIVE. @SecRubio This needs to be investigated and unveiled who's behind the destruction of the West?

It is funny that MAGA cultist want to challenge my blackness because of my education… 

Remember how they challenged Barack Obama & his roots? 

Remember how they claimed Kamala “turned”black. 

Y’all are a joke. Walk a day in my shoes where your white supremacist friends send me hateful emails, death threats, DMs, & posts, and then you can tell me if I’m truly living the black experience in this country, UNTIL then mind your business.  

*ALSO “being black” has nothing to do with education… (BUT for the record, if it did, just know that the MOST educated demographic in THIS country is BLACK WOMEN  so stop pretending like we are inferior in ANY WAY!)

NEW: Abigail Spanberger’s $50K CCP Donation Linked to Hunter Biden’s Beijing Benefactor

Campaign-finance filings show Virginia gubernatorial hopeful (and ex-CIA officer) Abigail Spanberger pocketed two $25,000 checks this spring from Pin Ni, president of Wanxiang America—a Chinese company whose founder was hailed as an “National Outstanding Communist Party Member.”   

Hunter Biden’s laptop ties the very same Pin Ni to the Biden family racket: 

Days after Ni met Joe Biden at the White House in July 2014, he emailed Hunter about fixing—and later upgrading—Hunter’s $142,000 Fisker sports car after Wanxiang bought the bankrupt EV maker. 

Spanberger brands herself a “national-security” expert, yet she’s cashing checks from the CCP middleman who cozied up to both Bidens while the laptop exposed their foreign-cash pipeline.  

This is Deep State royalty in living color: an Obama-era spy turned politician, now financed by the same Beijing-linked bagman who greased the Biden machine.  

Virginians don’t need another governor wired into Hunter’s hard-drive scandals—they need a firewall against communist cash and the swamp creatures who keep taking it.

Here’s a glimpse into waste and fraud in Puerto Rico: Between 2021 and 2024, the federal government allocated approximately $6 million to LGBTQ and migrant programs in Puerto Rico. Note: This is based on a quick search and not an in-depth analysis. 

Additionally, the Department of Defense spent over $2 billion on temporary power generation on the Island.

 THREAD: Following the Money Trail in Puerto Rico: Robert F. Mujica, Jr. 

I’ve been digging into Puerto Rico's tax incentives for a while now. That research quickly led into the world of fiscal governance and bankruptcy oversight.

One name kept surfacing: Robert F. Mujica, Jr.

Mujica is a former New York State Budget Director who now serves as Executive Director of Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB), the entity that oversees the island’s finances. And by some accounts, now making over 9× the Governor’s salary to “oversee” Puerto Rico’s finances. 

Paid with Puerto Rican taxpayer money, Mujica runs the Financial Oversight & Management Board, the group deciding how much gets cut and what gets sold off.

This is important as Americans debate the statehood of Puerto Rico.... 

Patience as I pull the thread together...

Hello @SenatorDurbin 
What was the purpose of your visit to Ukraine in 2014? Were you involved in initiating the Maidan Square events? Additionally, $95,000 was spent on an office paint job and carpet replacement? That amount seems excessive.

Amazon expose. Read the tip I received!
Steve,
It was good speaking with you the other day. I would like to write down how this Amazon thing is happening, but first need to put it into context how Amazon works.

Amazon allows third-party sellers to sell products on their website. This is not just their manufactured product, but products on Amazon from any brand. Third-party sellers represent 61% of Amazon's Marketplace. They had a revenue of 156 billion dollars in 2024. However, of all third-party sellers, almost half are from other countries. China, India, and Pakistan are some of where I see requests being made. That being said, the revenue they generate is being taken out of the US economy.

How are they doing this, you might ask. There are websites dedicated to teaching people in other countries how to set up businesses in the United States without ever being here. https://ecomera.us is one of them, based in Pakistan. They use registered agents in the US to set these businesses up and often use states with very little tax liability to avoid any tax being taken. 301 n gould st, Sheridan, WY, is one of the most common locations, but these are all over. They are in Florida and Texas as well and can provide where those most used are. Registered Agents Inc is one of the companies setting these companies up and as you see below they have many locations and also are setting businesses up that are creating scams.

https://registeredagentsinc.com/contact-us/

https://thesheridanpress.com/news/local/another-scam-recorded-from-business-related-to-30-n-gould-st-registered-agent/article_52b040ca-f622-11eb-a595-e7f2de685e62.html…

There is a lot to this, but this loophole needs to be closed at the federal government level. This is hurting our small businesses and our economy. This practice is being done on more than just Amazon. Walmart and eBay are also huge culprits.

Please let me know what other information you need me to elaborate on or provide more proof of. Thank you

Department of Education:
On August 1, 2025, the Department of Education awarded Accenture Federal Services LLC a $168.1 million contract, potentially rising to $936.7 million, for managing Title IV financial aid origination, disbursement systems, and customer service transition services. This involves handling key aspects of federal student aid programs. Accenture Federal Services, known for its progressive corporate stance, has secured over $20 billion in government contracts and plays a significant role in various federal education initiatives across agencies Including the DOD 6.5 Billion Dollars.
What's concerning about this situation is that the company's Chief Strategy Officer "Bhaskar Ghosh" is an Indian national residing in India. This individual oversees the company's program strategy, which involves secret and top-secret contracts, allowing a foreign national to access all the sensitive data.
Additionally, look at the company donation from 2024.

Elon Musk.
I identified two contracts linked to Elon Musk name. The first, from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the second, from the Department of State (DOS), involves the "Steps to Success Public Association" translating and publishing Elon Musk and the Quest for a Fantastic Future: Young Readers Edition. Additionally, the ISMRM Workshop on MRI of Neuromodulation, held October 17-19, 2022, at the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD, examined how MRI can improve neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and optical/ultrasonic methods to investigate brain circuits, enhance cognition, and treat neurological disorders. This pioneering ISMRM event united scientists, clinicians, and industry partners to explore advanced MRI techniques, pre-clinical models, safety, and clinical applications, aligning with the NIH BRAIN Initiative and public interest in brain-computer interfaces, such as those developed by Elon Musk’s Neuralink. The workshop included presentations, discussions, and poster sessions, prioritizing participation from trainees and underrepresented groups to advance MRI-guided therapies and biomarker development.
I wonder What and How much the Gov Used his name to advance a particular agenda before he backed up Trump?!

Breaking: NYC Shooter targeted Blackstone. 
Thomas Nides Blackstone vice Chairman ties to CNN

Thomas R. Nides is a Vice Chairman of Strategy and Client Relations at Blackstone, a position he has held since January 2024. His ties to CNN are through his wife, Virginia Carpenter Moseley, who is CNN’s Executive Editor and Senior Vice President of Newsgathering for the network's U.S. operations. They married in 1992 and have two adult children. There are no direct professional connections between Nides and CNN itself beyond this personal relationship. 

I wonder Why CNN initially ran cover for the shooter and called him a white man, and they did a complete U turn

Hello Michiganders: 
Crazy Redhead’s Bid for a Senate Seat in Michigan Raises Eyebrows!
Before politics, she designed for Mazda, pocketing $8M in taxpayer-funded contracts.
Then, she crafted toys for Mattel, cozy with China’s supply chains.
And at Gawker Media? She rubbed shoulders with Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, whose firm funneled cash to save the site from @HulkHogan $100M lawsuit.
From corporate deals to foreign ties, is this candidate’s past too wild for the Senate?
Also her Husband is worked at Gawker and he was Sr editor and chief and staffer for presidential candidate John Kerry. 
This woman is deep state as deep state gets. And if you live in Michigan you need need to ask yourself one question is she for you or against you. After this post you should know the facts.

Hello @ShawnRyan762, This political appointee is clueless, propped up as Deputy Assistant for the Middle East at DoD despite zero training in intelligence analysis no DIA-ICD203 "Pace" course or ODNI Analysis 101. (Check my attached graduation cert for the real deal.) Her only qualification? Her dad, a big-shot neocon tied to Reagan’s Iran-Contra scandal, where he brokered the arms-for-hostages deal. After that, he jumped to the American Enterprise Institute, a neocon hub pumping out Iraq and Afghanistan war propaganda. 
P.S. If you still in touch with her just ask her how many pages is the source validation forum.  
Ask @TPASarah I'm sure she's been to the same Intel courses I have.

Hello @ShawnRyan762, This political appointee is clueless, propped up as Deputy Assistant for the Middle East at DoD despite zero training in intelligence analysis no DIA-ICD203 "Pace" course or ODNI Analysis 101. (Check my attached graduation cert for the real deal.) Her only qualification? Her dad, a big-shot neocon tied to Reagan’s Iran-Contra scandal, where he brokered the arms-for-hostages deal. After that, he jumped to the American Enterprise Institute, a neocon hub pumping out Iraq and Afghanistan war propaganda. 
P.S. If you still in touch with her just ask her how many pages is the source validation forum.  
Ask @TPASarah I'm sure she's been to the same Intel courses I have.

Simone: "Hamza bin laden actual is not alive. He is dead. However, I do not dispute the fact that someone calling himself Hamza bin laden, perhaps even a bin laden cousin, is doing all of that."

Shawn: "My friend Sarah Adams, who who says that Hamza bin laden is still alive, that he is the leader. He's basically over all of these terrorist organizations which have united."

Lets expose @RpsAgainstTrump, and why they love illegal aliens: 
Unmasking the Anti-Trump Crew: Shady Deals & Big Bucks! 
Meet Sarah Longwell, a self-styled "never-Trumper" with a colorful past. After ditching U.S. Senator Rick Santorum over his anti-gay stance, she hopped to Berman and Company, which mysteriously scored $627K in 2020 and $615K in 2021 in SBA loans. How’d they snag that cash, and have they paid it back? The plot thickens! 
Then there’s Bill Kristol, another anti-Trump warrior with a serious case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. He’s not alone former GOP strategists Rick Wilson, Steve Schmidt, and Reed Galen are tied to The Lincoln Project, which we’ve exposed for pocketing $2.6M in taxpayer-funded kickstarts. 
And who’s bankrolling this circus? Jimmy Tosh, a Tennessee billionaire and hog empire kingpin. Running Tosh Farms, Tosh Pork, and Bacon By Gosh, this third-generation farmer turned 316 acres into an 18,000-acre swine juggernaut, producing over 1M hogs yearly. Tosh raked in $818K from the USDA and a whopping $4.2M in SBA loans still unpaid. 
What’s the deal with these loans, and who’s really pulling the strings? Stay tuned as I dig deeper!

Hey @keithedwards, since you were involved with the Lincoln Project As their digital director, I’d like to point out that they received a $2.8 million taxpayer-funded kickstart. I brought this up in an unrelated post yesterday. So, it’s clear you’re not being upfront, and I’m curious-what was your cut of that $2.8 million for running their digital campaign?
You guys are all fraud and been offloading off of the backs of the taxpayers for years.

    Colorado:
Maybe If Colorado spend less money on LGBTQ BS will have a better budget? 
Here's one program. Denver Health Hospital Authority (DHHA) is a 555-bed acute-care hospital with Level 1 adult and Level 2 pediatric trauma centers. It serves as the Region 8 Regional Emerging Special Pathogens Treatment Center (RESPTC) with a Biocontainment Unit (BCU) established in 2015, featuring two critical care beds, a high-risk pathogen lab, and 70 airborne isolation rooms. The High-Risk Infection Team (HITEAM) conducts multidisciplinary training every six weeks, including donning/doffing PPE, quarterly drills, and didactic series. DHHA also houses specialized centers for eating disorders, psychiatric care, addiction medicine, and LGBTQ+ care, along with 19 federal health centers, 12 school-based clinics, and the Denver 911 system. Located near Denver International Airport and military bases, DHHA collaborates with NETEC to maintain RESPTC standards and supports regional healthcare training.
The total money wasted on programs included LGBTQ was 35 million in the past 4 years.

    Tylenol Steady:
Between 2022 and 2024, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided a $150,000 grant to the University of North Texas to study the effects of Tylenol use during pregnancy and its potential link to autism. Share this with anyone dismissing the concerns raised by RFK Jr. and Donald Trump.

The steady concluded "About 65% of pregnant women in the US use acetaminophen (Tylenol in the US, paracetamol in Europe). Despite concerns about its safety during pregnancy, including risks of liver damage, developmental issues, and conditions like autism or hyperkinetic disorders, it is widely used and endorsed by US doctors and the FDA. While some medications taken during pregnancy, like diethylstilbestrol (DES), are known to increase cancer risk in children, the potential cancer risk from acetaminophen is not well-studied. This study will use Taiwan’s national health databases, including maternal and child health records and cancer registries, to investigate whether acetaminophen use during pregnancy is linked to childhood cancer. The goal is to provide better evidence on its safety to guide regulatory decisions."

    Long Thread Who's behind Antifa. Meet itsgoingdown org
First what's antifa?
A Communist and Anarchist Movement Openly Supporting Violence
Antifa, a revolutionary Marxist and anarchist militia, aims to dismantle the United States through violence and intimidation. According to a September 2017 report in The Atlantic, Antifa has fueled a level of continuous political street conflict unmatched in the U.S. since the 1960s.  Short for “antifascist,” Antifa is often associated with the red-and-black flag of anarcho-communism. The Antifa-affiliated website http://ItsGoingDown.org explains that in the U.S., most activists are anarchists, with some identifying as Maoist or anti-state Marxists, while globally, the movement leans heavily Marxist. U.S.-based Antifa anarchists reject capitalism and government institutions, openly promoting violence to destabilize and eliminate both. Their ultimate goal is to establish a global communist order.

The couple married in 2014 in a ceremony officiated by an Islamic imam at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Centre in Virginia, which has drawn controversy due to the imam's alleged ties to radical groups. Mills and Al Saadi co-founded PACEM Solutions International LLC, a defense and security firm, in 2014, and they have two children together. Recent reports indicate Mills was separated from Al Saadi by late 2021 and claimed to an ex-girlfriend that their divorce was finalized in 2024, though as of September 2025, public records and statements still describe him as married.

    MAJOR BREAKING: State Department & UN ties to Armed Queers SLC leader now confirmed 

First, credit to @SKDoubleDub33 for the crucial tip, PLEASE follow, they'll be doing a podcast on this soon.

Here’s what you need to know:

 Armed Queers SLC is under investigation for possible foreknowledge of Charlie Kirk’s assassination.

 Their leader, Ermiya Fanaeian, was recognized by a State Dept–affiliated NGO, Utah Global Diplomacy, as a recipient of the "7 for 17" Award for advancing the UN's 17 Goals 

 Utah Global Diplomacy has since scrubbed Fanaeian's presence from their website. Unknown when this purge happened. The receipts remain.

Patience as I pull this thread together.

    Thread In the memory of Iryna Zaruska:
Since the tragic killing of Iryna Zaruska by Decarlos Brown Jr., I’ve been reflecting deeply on the situation, choosing to remain silent until now. As the Political Adviser for the Ukraine Mission at SAG-U in Germany from 2023 to 2024, and with my former partner being Ukrainian, I was closely involved in the Ukraine operation. The harsh reality of crisis-driven immigration and migration, particularly through the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program, has been weighing on me. This program, which saw over 187,000 Ukrainians arrive in the U.S. by March 2024, distributed many to liberal cities under DHS guidance.
Earlier data reported 117,000 arrivals by February 2023 and 123,962 sponsorship requests with 50,832 arrivals by September 2022. The program was halted on January 28, 2025, and is no longer accepting new applications.

    Bob Woodward: Journalism’s Shameless Profiteer.:

Bob Woodward, a U.S. Navy veteran who served as a lieutenant from 1965 to 1970, may be lauded for Watergate, but his career is a cesspool of ethical failures and brazen sensationalism. His addiction to insider access, hoarding bombshell scoops like Trump’s COVID-19 lies for book deals, and pushing discredited stories—like the fabricated Casey interview in Veil—lay bare a journalist driven by greed, not truth. Critics like Joan Didion scorn his bloated, gossip-soaked books as vacuous and directionless, propping up powerful sources while dodging systemic corruption. His tired, sycophantic formula and shaky accuracy shred his credibility. Most galling, Woodward bailed on a congressional delegation to the Security Assistant Group-Ukraine (SAGU-U) after forcing exhaustive preparations, showcasing his arrogant disregard for others. Shockingly, the Dubuque Museum of Art still props him up, ignoring a legacy built on self-aggrandizement rather than integrity.

    The Young Turks: 
Here's the deal: The Young Turks reportedly received $1,194,955.70 in SBA loans that remain unpaid. A critical question is, how many employees did they have to qualify for such a large amount? SBA loans come with strict eligibility requirements, and there's concern that some businesses may be falsifying documents to secure larger funds.

The Taliban have a ritual called "Paradise, Fairies, and Extremism," which tells the story of an Afghan youth nearly turned into a "fidai." The term "fidai" (also spelled fida'i or fedayi) is Arabic for "one who sacrifices himself." It involves brainwashing young kids to carry out suicide missions on behalf of their elders. 
There is a good reason these people are furious with @TPASarah because she's exposing them on a deep level.

    It is funny that MAGA cultist want to challenge my blackness because of my education… 

Remember how they challenged Barack Obama & his roots? 

Remember how they claimed Kamala “turned”black. 

Y’all are a joke. Walk a day in my shoes where your white supremacist friends send me hateful emails, death threats, DMs, & posts, and then you can tell me if I’m truly living the black experience in this country, UNTIL then mind your business.  

*ALSO “being black” has nothing to do with education… (BUT for the record, if it did, just know that the MOST educated demographic in THIS country is BLACK WOMEN  so stop pretending like we are inferior in ANY WAY!)

    THREAD: Following the Money Trail in Puerto Rico: Robert F. Mujica, Jr. 

I’ve been digging into Puerto Rico's tax incentives for a while now. That research quickly led into the world of fiscal governance and bankruptcy oversight.

One name kept surfacing: Robert F. Mujica, Jr.

Mujica is a former New York State Budget Director who now serves as Executive Director of Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB), the entity that oversees the island’s finances. And by some accounts, now making over 9× the Governor’s salary to “oversee” Puerto Rico’s finances. 

Paid with Puerto Rican taxpayer money, Mujica runs the Financial Oversight & Management Board, the group deciding how much gets cut and what gets sold off.

This is important as Americans debate the statehood of Puerto Rico.... 

Patience as I pull the thread together...

    Elon Musk.
I identified two contracts linked to Elon Musk name. The first, from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the second, from the Department of State (DOS), involves the "Steps to Success Public Association" translating and publishing Elon Musk and the Quest for a Fantastic Future: Young Readers Edition. Additionally, the ISMRM Workshop on MRI of Neuromodulation, held October 17-19, 2022, at the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD, examined how MRI can improve neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and optical/ultrasonic methods to investigate brain circuits, enhance cognition, and treat neurological disorders. This pioneering ISMRM event united scientists, clinicians, and industry partners to explore advanced MRI techniques, pre-clinical models, safety, and clinical applications, aligning with the NIH BRAIN Initiative and public interest in brain-computer interfaces, such as those developed by Elon Musk’s Neuralink. The workshop included presentations, discussions, and poster sessions, prioritizing participation from trainees and underrepresented groups to advance MRI-guided therapies and biomarker development.
I wonder What and How much the Gov Used his name to advance a particular agenda before he backed up Trump?!

    Breaking: NYC Shooter targeted Blackstone. 
Thomas Nides Blackstone vice Chairman ties to CNN

Thomas R. Nides is a Vice Chairman of Strategy and Client Relations at Blackstone, a position he has held since January 2024. His ties to CNN are through his wife, Virginia Carpenter Moseley, who is CNN’s Executive Editor and Senior Vice President of Newsgathering for the network's U.S. operations. They married in 1992 and have two adult children. There are no direct professional connections between Nides and CNN itself beyond this personal relationship. 

I wonder Why CNN initially ran cover for the shooter and called him a white man, and they did a complete U turn

Meet Sarah Longwell, a self-styled "never-Trumper" with a colorful past. After ditching U.S. Senator Rick Santorum over his anti-gay stance, she hopped to Berman and Company, which mysteriously scored $627K in 2020 and $615K in 2021 in SBA loans. How’d they snag that cash, and have they paid it back? The plot thickens! 
Then there’s Bill Kristol, another anti-Trump warrior with a serious case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. He’s not alone former GOP strategists Rick Wilson, Steve Schmidt, and Reed Galen are tied to The Lincoln Project, which we’ve exposed for pocketing $2.6M in taxpayer-funded kickstarts. 
And who’s bankrolling this circus? Jimmy Tosh, a Tennessee billionaire and hog empire kingpin. Running Tosh Farms, Tosh Pork, and Bacon By Gosh, this third-generation farmer turned 316 acres into an 18,000-acre swine juggernaut, producing over 1M hogs yearly. Tosh raked in $818K from the USDA and a whopping $4.2M in SBA loans still unpaid. 
What’s the deal with these loans, and who’s really pulling the strings? Stay tuned as I dig deeper!

    THREAD: Honduras as a case study for mass migraton

I poked around into the Honduras story a bit more thanks to prodding from a subscriber. The subscriber insisted that there had to be beneficiaries or the "closed loop" where destabilization -> displacement -> resettlement would not have gone on so long unnoticed. 

And, yes, the history of Honduras is very much interesting and educational... and I'm going to try my best to share what I've collected below

    Thread: Could Seeding In Texas. First lets explore what's cloud Seeding is. Cloud seeding in Texas is a weather modification technique aimed at enhancing rainfall to combat drought, replenish water supplies, and support agriculture. It involves dispersing substances like silver iodide or calcium chloride into clouds to stimulate precipitation, typically using aircraft to release these materials into convective clouds (cumulus or thunderstorms). The practice has been used in Texas since the 1950s, with modern programs regulated by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) under the Texas Weather Modification Act of 1967.

    Breaking News: Secretary Marco Rubio announced today that USAID has officially ceased operations. However, a review of the State Department’s hiring portal and USAJobs reveals open positions exclusively for former USAID employees. This indicates that, rather than closing, USAID may be transitioning its staff to roles within the State Department, raising questions about the continuity of the same shady personnel.

    Fourth of July Government Spending: Your Tax Dollars at Work?If you're pinching pennies to cover bills and can't afford to celebrate Independence Day, here's something to chew on. The Department of the Interior (DOI) dropped $546,780 on June 2, 2025, for a 4th of July bash. On June 11, 2025, the State Department shelled out $18,630, while another State Department division spent $12,205 on June 12, 2025. Not to be outdone, a different DOI division allocated $35,992 on June 27, 2025. Government officials are partying hard on your taxpayer dollars.

    OnlyFans And Ukrainian Ties Unveiled: The Billionaire Powering Your Feed.
Millions pour money into OnlyFans for exclusive content, but who’s behind it? 
Leonid Radvinsky, a Ukrainian-American billionaire who owns Fenix International, the company running OnlyFans. After securing full control in 2018, he drove the platform to a staggering $1.3 billion in 2023 revenue. 

But Radvinsky’s reach goes further—his empire spans:

MyFreeCams: A major adult webcam platform he launched in 2004.

Cybertania Inc.: A controversial web referral business he co-founded at 17.

Leo: A venture fund fueling tech startups like B4X and Pleroma.
Radvinsky isn’t just profiting—he’s redefining digital culture. When you subscribe, you’re part of his bold vision.
A Curious Aside:
OnlyFans and CodePink? 
Could there be a link through feminist ideals? CodePink champions anti-militarist feminism, pushing for peace and justice. OnlyFans’ CEO, Keily Blair, claims the platform empowers women, especially in sex work, by offering financial freedom. Yet, CodePink’s anti-capitalist ethos clashes with OnlyFans’ profit-driven model, often criticized for exploiting vulnerabilities. No direct ties exist—CodePink hasn’t addressed OnlyFans, and their feminist visions diverge sharply. Just an intriguing contrast in how women’s empowerment is framed.

FYI Andrew Tate was demonized by doing the same @Cobratate. I am vouching for anyone, I am seeking for your opinions at this point.

Considered a terrorist organization by many including Canada where they are based, they support paid Hamas protestors who want the elimination of Israel as their ONE STATE solution.

Money donated by Soros to Tides Foundation to Alliance For Global Justice to Popular Front for the liberation of Palestine and SAMIDOUN. . Lot of money laundering to hide the source. 

Did I see in the future the Soros money is confiscated because of Crimes Against Humanity? And Soros is no more! 
Justice is coming!

Before slithering into politics, NYC’s socialist darling Zohran Mamdani worked at Chhaya Community Development Corporation, a Queens nonprofit. Conveniently, once Mamdani snagged his Assembly seat, Chhaya started raking in over $3.7 million in government funds. Coincidence? Or a calculated move by a politician using "housing justice" as a front for funneling taxpayer dollars to his old cronies? Voters deserve answers!

    Subject: Urgent Recommendations for Secure Troop Deployments
Dear @SecDef @PeteHegseth 

To safeguard our troops during deployments, I strongly recommend the following measures to enhance operational security:

1- Secure Electronic Devices: Prior to any troop movements, collect all personal electronic devices to prevent unauthorized recordings or leaks that could compromise missions. This step ensures our forces remain stealthy and secure.

2- Ban Garmin Devices: Implement a policy prohibiting Garmin watches during deployments. In 2017, an incident in Iraq exposed how these devices’ public geolocation data jeopardized troop safety. Let’s eliminate this vulnerability.

3- Enforce GPS Restrictions: Upon arrival at deployment destinations, mandate that NCOs verify all soldiers’, sailors’, airmen’s, and marines’ phone GPS settings are disabled. This critical check minimizes the risk of geolocation-based targeting by adversaries.

By adopting these proactive measures, we can significantly reduce risks and protect our service members. Thank you for prioritizing their safety.

Sincerely,
Alladdin,

    Hello @RealCandaceO 
Pushing folks to dodge orders and risk dishonorable discharge over disagreements with leadership is like handing them a career death sentence. It’s reckless advice—here’s why it’s a terrible idea:

1- Sworn Duty: Service members vow to defend the Constitution and follow the Commander-in-Chief’s orders. Deploying on command is in the contract they signed—non-negotiable.

2- Career Killer: Encouraging disobedience could lead to an Article 15 and a dishonorable discharge. That’s a lifelong stain, stripping them of veteran status and benefits. Will you offer them a job to fix that mess?

3- No Vet Protections: A dishonorable discharge means no veteran-protected status for jobs. They’re left high and dry in the civilian world.

4- Permanent Consequences: That discharge haunts their record forever, locking them out of hard-earned benefits like healthcare and education.

Ditch your military career? That’s not just bad advice—it’s a slap in the face to your sacrifice. Think hard. A dishonorable discharge means explaining to employers why your training certs come with a side of stigma, not veteran status.

My Advise to LG19 do not listen to Candace.

    Afghanistan: 
 @TPASarah stated approximately $3.5 billion allocated for Afghanistan is managed by State Department officials in Switzerland. The specific statement was: "As I’ve mentioned before, $3.5 billion was discreetly transferred to Switzerland, where it’s now overseen by two Afghan representatives, a State Department official, and a Swiss government entity. We were told this fund could be accessed by the Taliban to cover expenses, such as issuing passports."

I may have uncovered where this money is being channeled—potentially through companies like Koenig & Bauer Banknote Solutions and Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd., both based in Allschwil, Switzerland. From 2022 to the present, over $20 billion has reportedly been directed to Switzerland. Here’s a breakdown of the allocations by agency: 
The key questions are why the State Department funneled $10.7 billion to Switzerland, why the Department of Defense (DOD) spent over $800 million, and, most strikingly, why USAID allocated more than $8 billion there. Switzerland is not a developing nation, so what justifies these massive transfers?
@TPASarah I think the money is more than you estimated

    My thoughts are with the people of Los Angeles. History will remember Trump as a wannabe authoritarian who was willing to sacrifice the safety of his fellow Americans in order to try to score cheap political points. This is not how a strong leader responds to protest -- it's what a weak, insecure man does.

    DOD RFID Tags and failed audits. 
The Department of Defense (DoD) has invested over $160 million in RFID tags, yet it hasn't passed an audit in over a decade. If the DoD can't effectively track its assets with RFID technology, what's the point of the expenditure? Given the government's enthusiasm for using RFID to monitor equipment, can it track the weapons left behind for the Taliban? Here are some examples below: 
FYI: If I use different search terms i will pull more money the number in the billions invested in RFID's

    Raquel Debono, known as #raqisright on Instagram, has been featured by reputable outlets such as the New York Post @nypost.  
While Ms. Debono’s visibility has increased, it appears that the original creator of the "Make America Hot Again" campaign has not been properly credited. 
The New York Post previously reported on the individual who pioneered this concept, yet recent coverage seems to overlook this fact in favor of promoting Ms. Debono. 
 
As a result, Ms. Debono is benefiting from online sales tied to a campaign she did not originate. I respectfully urge your publication to clarify the attribution of this concept to its rightful creator and ensure accurate representation in future coverage.

    4 Parts Thread: How USAID redirected $95,490,240 from Tunisia to Yemen then Gaza, and the West Bank, initiating the process in 2018 with final approval and signing on January 18, 2025.

How did this whole thing started?
In 08/15/2018 USAID approved $95,490,240 in Tunisia for "The purpose of GISR MENA is to sustainably strengthen local, national, and regional systems to adapt to shocks and stressors in the MENA region." GISR stands for (Governance Integration for Stabilization and Resilience).  The performance period was supposed to be from  08/15/2018 to 08/14/2023.

As you can see below from the original contract spending.

    4 Parts Thread: How USAID redirected $95,490,240 from Tunisia to Yemen then Gaza, and the West Bank, initiating the process in 2018 with final approval and signing on January 18, 2025.

How did this whole thing started?
In 08/15/2018 USAID approved $95,490,240 in Tunisia for "The purpose of GISR MENA is to sustainably strengthen local, national, and regional systems to adapt to shocks and stressors in the MENA region." GISR stands for (Governance Integration for Stabilization and Resilience).  The performance period was supposed to be from  08/15/2018 to 08/14/2023.

As you can see below from the original contract spending.

    Understanding Top Secret Information and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).

Many individuals claim to hold Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) clearances and possess exclusive knowledge. However, most do not have access to the full scope of classified information. The purpose of SCI, "REL TO" designations, and other classification protocols is to restrict information on a need-to-know basis, compartmentalizing access to protect sensitive data. For further details, refer to ICD 704 or Intelligence Community Standards (ICS) 705-1 and 705-2.

As a former intelligence officer and analyst with the highest-level government security clearance, I still lacked access to all classified information, as access is strictly limited to what is necessary for one’s role.

FYI this program all across different agencies and gives incentive to people to buy EV because its free charge and better parking location at work I experienced that at my previous Gov job they promoted this heavily.

    An obscure government agency unfamiliar to most. Read the last part of the thread that relates to Canada. 
Have you ever stumbled across the shadowy MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION? Most haven’t—it’s a clandestine government agency cloaked in the deceptive guise of a corporate name, lurking in the depths of bureaucratic obscurity.

Let’s shine a light on their reckless spending.

A preliminary search indicates over $600 million, though this figure is based on a cursory investigation and requires further research for accuracy.

Below an example of what that means. 
What you see here that we got a tip from the kids in town that this house belongs to terrorists. 
The person you see going over the gate is me. 

FYI this is the side gate this house was a corner house and had three entrees.

We inspected all the walls and the all had glass shrapnels to prevent people from jumping over 

I took a risk, when I jumped over one of the side gates as I suspected there doors was booby trapped  with grenades. later after going over the house almost every wall was booby trapped with 155 ml artillery shells. Thanks to the kids who gave us the tip. 
PS that day we waited for EOD for 9 hours to show up to blow up the house.

    ScoopNationwide Tesla/ Gov Protest April 5th
Indivisible has scheduled another Tesla protest, set to take place in Hollywood, Florida.
I received an anonymous tip indicating that Lauren Donsky-Levine, identified as a reservist FEMA employee, is involved in organizing the event through Facebook. Supporting materials, including pictures and flyers, are provided below.
Additionally, it appears that Army Brigadier General Curt Alan Rauhut, who reportedly liked her post, is currently serving as a commander with the United Nations, according to his public profile.

I recently identified an instance where an individual at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is authorizing payments of $11,720 to individuals with registered home businesses. 
There are 34 such payments documented, with seven additional payments scheduled for release in the near future.
 Attached is an example of one such payment, along with details of the remaining seven recipients slated to receive these funds. Notably, I observed that all approvals appear to have been authorized by the same individual, as indicated in the top right corner of the first document.

    Exposing Rep. Hakeem Jeffries And USAID Kickbacks to the Democrats
On April 21, 2023, the State Department spent $16,398 on Hakeem Jeffries’ lodging in Ghana for a two-day visit. Reports suggest the trip aimed to boost U.S.-Ghana economic ties and enhance border and coastal shipping cooperation. 
"Hotel receipt below." 

Yet, a grim shadow looms. In April 2023, Ghana’s economy teetered as IMF bailout talks stumbled. X posts near April 25 flagged a stalled $3 billion deal due to missed meetings, with soaring inflation and debt fueling unease. Relief arrived in May, but April simmered with strain. 

Compounding the gloom, USAID poured $1.21 billion into Ghana from 2021 to late 2024, a stark contrast to the economic turmoil of April 2023, when IMF bailout delays deepened the nation’s inflation and debt struggles. 

Did the Dems force the IMF to bailout Ghana?

    How The Chines Gov Luring fired or laid off Gov Employees
Reuters has published an article exposing efforts by the Chinese government to attract recently terminated U.S. federal employees.

According to job postings and a researcher who discovered the operation, a group of companies controlled by a discreet Chinese technology firm has been attempting to hire these laid-off government workers as of March 25.

Below is one of the companies. I highly recommend that you don't open the company link.

    IOM Iraq operation. They received over 500 million dollars to process Iraqis applications to the U.S and the U.K who worked with coalition forces there as local national. Well there was a flaw in the process to start with IOM heired Kurdish, Arab's and Christians from the U.S and the UK to operate there. Two things happened.
1- These staffers started falsifying documents to bring their family members and friends 
2- These staffers started charging strangers 10k a pop through a third party connection to also falsify documents and bring people to the U.S and UK 
In both cases the falsification in the documents was making these applicants looks like they worked with coalition forces when in all reality they didn't. 
I personally know 4 Iraqi families they came here that way and they paid their way into the U.S and they reside in TN
below is the total funding for the Iraq operation

Upon executing a search query with the terms "Wisconsin" and "Election," I retrieved results indicating that Amentum Services, Inc., a Virginia-based organization, is designated as providing "U.S. Seconded Personnel and Election Observers." At present, the linkage between this company and Wisconsin remains unclear from the data obtained, and I am unable to fully ascertain the basis for their involvement in this context. Additional research may be warranted to elucidate their role and relevance. I urge all interested parties to remain vigilant regarding these expenditures and activities. Should further clarification or assistance be needed to interpret these findings, I am available to provide support.
Additionally, The prison system is also making huge efforts into the mail in ballots historically so be on the lookout for that below is Amentum transaction and historical mail in ballots transaction for the prison system

Continuing the focus on South Africa, Since 2010 taxpayer-funded trips taken by Hunter Biden prior to his father's assumption of the presidency. This matter warrants attention as, in the absence of a presidential role, the expectation is that family members' travel expenses should be privately funded rather than supported by public resources. It should be noted that Secret Service protection, funded through the Department of Homeland Security, operates under a separate budgetary allocation, distinct from these travel costs.
Additionally, these details pertain solely to trips logged in the government database specific to South Africa. Further investigation has revealed evidence of numerous other international trips undertaken by Hunter Biden, including destinations such as the Philippines, Denmark, Germany, France, and several additional locations. these trips go's 

1- The 1st, 2nd and 3rd picture below is South Africa 4 trips and one detailed example of his visit transportation by tax payers money

    @matt_vanswol and @brandinedgin  ask and you Shall receive
 Here's 174.2 Millions for Carbon steady for University of Oklahoma. from NASA 
NASA has chosen a unique Earth science mission called the Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory (GeoCarb) to study greenhouse gases and vegetation health from space. This mission will help us better understand how carbon moves between Earth's land, atmosphere, and oceans. GeoCarb will be launched on a commercial satellite and will orbit 22,000 miles above the equator, focusing on the Americas. 
The mission's main goals are to:
Monitor plant health and stress across the Americas

Study the natural sources and sinks of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane in the atmosphere

Improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle

GeoCarb will use a special instrument to measure sunlight reflected from Earth, which will help determine the amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. It will also measure a type of fluorescence from plants that gives information about photosynthesis. This mission was selected from 15 proposals submitted to NASA's Earth Venture program for small space-based studies of the Earth system.
132 million already spent we can claw back the rest. Also they need to be asked what they found so far. I bet you they have no answer

    Condoms for LATINX And other people of color
Check this out on Jul 01, 2021 the HHS awarded THE DAMIEN CENTER INC 1.76 million dollar for The Damien Center, a nonprofit in Indianapolis, proposes the Latinx Prevention Program to reduce HIV infections among Latinx MSM in Marion County, Indiana—one of 48 counties hardest hit by HIV per the CDC. The program will expand HIV testing, link more Latinx individuals to care (medical, ART, PrEP, and support services), and improve health equity. Short-term goals include increasing HIV status awareness, enhancing care access, boosting PrEP and condom availability, and improving cluster response. Long-term outcomes aim to lower new infections, improve health for those with HIV, reduce disparities, and decrease HIV-related deaths. 
There are few contracts like this are still in progress for the same exact amount. Below few examples in 4 different states

Even more absurd on 02/27/2024 GSA spent $34,888  to PUT UP AND REMOVE ST. PATRICK'S DAY FENCING. and added some other none sense to the contract language. This one took place in IL district 7 
PS these type of spending are separatrices and not common with DOD practice. These type of reckless spending needs to end. It happens all the time within the federal gov.

    Photo Project On Israel/ Arab borderUSAID funded a photo project called "Photo Salam Activity," hiring Israeli photographer Eyal Landsman to lead it for 1.3 million dollars. 

The initiative seeks to foster greater coexistence by shifting public perceptions and attitudes toward diversity and a shared society. It will offer Arab and Jewish residents, including young adults and youth, a cooperative platform and photography skills training.

I wonder if they used the new skills to aide Hamas.

    Climate Change Research ScamOn 01/29/2024 the NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER allocated $796,158.00 in which "100k already spent" to VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE & STATE UNIVERSITY to steady sea water rising level.  I dug deep into it and found an updated contract description the initial stated this "The interplay between land user decisions and landcover change in coastal ecosystems and working lands under sea level rise in the mid Atlantic US" on 03/04/2025 they updated the contract and put bunch of fancy language "screen shot captured below. Basically this steady will influence local lawmaker to change laws and force landowners to sale their land to developers.
FYI 695k can be cut immediately because only 100k was released so far.  
PS thanks to @grok for simplifying the language

    Climate Change Research ScamOn 01/29/2024 the NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER allocated $796,158.00 in which "100k already spent" to VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE & STATE UNIVERSITY to steady sea water rising level.  I dug deep into it and found an updated contract description the initial stated this "The interplay between land user decisions and landcover change in coastal ecosystems and working lands under sea level rise in the mid Atlantic US" on 03/04/2025 they updated the contract and put bunch of fancy language "screen shot captured below. Basically this steady will influence local lawmaker to change laws and force landowners to sale their land to developers.
FYI 695k can be cut immediately because only 100k was released so far.  
PS thanks to @grok for simplifying the language

    How's Victor Pinchuk indirectly connected to USAID and Open Society foundation. 
Pinchuk’s influence and his foundation’s focus on education and health suggest possible overlap with USAID-supported areas. Projects like “http://Zavtra.UA” or the Yalta European Strategy might have linked to USAID initiatives via partnerships or subcontracts, often through firms like Chemonics or direct grants to NGOs. Still, no solid proof—contracts, grants, or statements—shows USAID directly funding Pinchuk or his foundation.

    Climate fund ScamThe EPA awarded 7 billion Dollars in April 2024 to CLIMATE UNITED FUND. Climate United is a coalition of three nonprofits focused on advancing green technologies and climate solutions across the country. 
The craziest thing is that Climate United was only established on 09/20/2023 and received a 7 billion in April 2024. This is shady as it gets. Transaction registration below.

The craziest thing there is no direct backing deposit to Syria since mid 2000's and 99% of the Iraqi banks under sanctions so they can't receive SWIFT transactions.

Its the best way to avoid state and local taxes. Also, I believe because we have a lot of retirees and they live abroad to avoid federal taxes. There is a loophole where you can get refunds through the German VAT. Some retiree I met in Germany back in 2023 and i don't remember the details when she explained it to me.

Basically, she's a far-left activist.

PS.  This is the same Un-Named company that received billions of dollars from the DOD, DHS, State Dept, USAID and many other agencies. 

FYI. This is a snippet of the contracts. The list is long.

Additionally, I blocked the approver name on the top of the page because I don't want to Dox the person. Will leave that to the appropriate authorities to investigate.

    Roadmap On How to Fix the Federal Government Staffing. Going forward the Trump Admin should;
1- Incentivize the Gov employees to exercise cost cutting instead of spending their yearly budget and request more for the next physical year "Oct 31" is the gov end of the Physical year for those who don't know And those cost cutting masseurs should be highlighted at their end of the year performance EVAL Specially for supervisors levels and up because they control the budget.
2- Any military personals O6 and above if they are 1 years from retirement they should not be allowed to write any justification for any GS/GG14 position and up. Because they are expanding their division and writing up and securing their next Job "It happens all the time".
3- There should be an honest survey about federal employees when they get asked if you are happy with your job or not then they should be able to answer the truth with out retaliation. This way you can sit down with the employee and figure out why they are not happy and maybe transfer them to a different mission where they can be more productive and serve the mission better.
4- The race and gender also Veteran status/ disability should be taken out from the hiring equation because no disrespect to anyone who served but there are a lot of veterans apply for jobs they are completely not qualified for and they get them because the point system we currently have for Vet preference "this will piss a lot of people off" I'm sorry but its the truth. Simple If you have the skills you get the job if you don't then you don't. 
5- Every new hire right out of college should be properly vetted and the clearance investigators should dig into their association with the college/ or universities groups. A lot of these kids are activist and they obtain TS/SCI and becomes Intel Analyst and Intel Officers. 
All the things I mentioned I have observed and seen when I was in the Federal Gov. There is more details to each step if the right folks take notice I can help. 

"If you see this please share and lets fix this thing".

    Alert: The Monster You Never Heard Of  "USAGM"
USAGM claims to broadcast truth, foster democracy, and promote freedom, but at its core, it serves as a tool for advancing U.S. foreign policy interests. Under the guise of providing "uncensored, unbiased news," it selectively reports to align with geopolitical strategies, often skewing narratives to fit political agendas.

What They Really Do:
Controlled Narratives: We operate in over 60 languages, but our content is carefully curated to influence public opinion in favor of U.S. interests, especially in regions of strategic importance.
Propaganda Portfolio: Including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks, and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, all strategically used to counter anti-U.S. sentiments.
Manipulation Through Technology: We use advanced tech not just to bypass censorship but to control the information flow, ensuring only narratives that support U.S. policy are amplified.
Real 'Achievements':
Digital Manipulation: Our digital expansion isn't just about reach; it's about crafting digital echo chambers where dissenting voices are marginalized.
Selective Journalism: Awards we receive are often for reporting that conveniently aligns with U.S. geopolitical goals, not necessarily for journalistic integrity.

    One million dead is a staggering loss of life and Americans were forced to pay for it by the hundreds of billions.

Washington’s sick obsession with funding the military industrial complex rather than seeking peace caused this tragedy.

    Thread Today, I received a tip from a close associate whom I first met while working at the FBI Terrorist Screening Center in Vienna, Virginia, where she served as a contractor. Following that role, she secured another contract position with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Maryland. Most recently, she was employed by Celestar Corporation.

According to her, Celestar Corporation accused her of harassment—an allegation that appears to lack substantive basis or identifiable complainants. She also noted that Celestar Corporation presents itself as a small, veteran-owned business, yet it operates two subsidiary companies under a parent entity known as Celestar Holdings Corporation.

    Portland: 
In light of the recent incident involving the unlawful arrest of Nick Sortor and the ongoing targeting of conservatives who have been supporting ICE personnel, I felt it was important to review and evaluate the federal funding being directed to the City of Portland.

Here’s one example of a federally funded contract I found:

Expand MCL’s capacity to provide follow-up support for high-risk 988 callers.

Improve coordination among crisis stabilization, respite, and mobile crisis services.

Strengthen partnerships with law enforcement to reduce unnecessary police involvement.

Enhance collaboration between 911 and 988 to ensure timely mental health responses.

Increase engagement with high-risk groups, including people of color, individuals in substance use treatment, people experiencing homelessness, and LGBTQ+ individuals.

The overall funding for BS programs for the city of Portland is over 14 millions.

In a jaw-dropping move, a 2015 grant funneled a staggering $57.9 million to Moderna TX, fueling the rise of mRNA technology in the shadows.
This is just one grant. There are so many out there.

    DoD's mRNA Funding Bombshell Long before the COVID-19 crisis gripped the world, the Department of Defense was quietly pouring millions into mRNA development. In a jaw-dropping move, a 2015 grant funneled a staggering $57.9 million to Moderna TX, fueling the rise of mRNA technology in the shadows.
This is just one grant. There are so many out there.

    @DOWResponse, One key reason for delays in federal projects is contract protests. When a company loses a contract during rebidding, they can file a protest, delaying the new company's start by 90 days. This doesn't help the protesting company regain the contract but allows them to continue receiving taxpayer funds for three more months. This practice must stop immediately. Below is one example of these contracts for $93.8 Million and potentially go up to $210.4 Million. Please comment and share. Thank you!

    Albania: 
CDC's Influence on Global COVID Policies Through Funding and Partnerships.
I've recently discovered an organization closely linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that plays a key role in shaping health policies in other countries via financial support and grants. 
Allow me to introduce The Task Force for Global Health, Inc., a nonprofit based in Decatur, Georgia just a short distance from the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta. This proximity underscores the strong ties between the two entities, with The Task Force often partnering with the CDC on international initiatives, including vaccine distribution, disease surveillance, and public health strengthening in over 150 countries. 
A notable example is a CDC-funded grant channeled through The Task Force to support COVID-19 immunization and health system improvements in Albania. Valued at $54.8 million overall, the project has already disbursed $47.4 million, with the remainder still available for allocation as the initiative continues through 2026. This funding, part of broader CDC efforts to aid low- and middle-income nations like Albania in rolling out COVID-19 vaccines and building resilient public health infrastructure, highlights how U.S. resources indirectly influence global policy responses to the pandemic. 
Given the ongoing nature of the program, there may be opportunities to review or redirect the unspent funds to align with evolving priorities.

    HHS Spending in HIV Testing for Transgender and LGBTQ+ Communities.
Did you know that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has allocated $2.43 billion for HIV testing targeting transgender and other LGBTQ+ groups from 2015 to the present, with 90% of the funds spent since 2021? Active grants, such as a $75.8 million initiative in New York City running from 2024 to 2029, focus on LGBTQIA+ individuals aged 13–29. The graph highlights that New York and California leading the pack.

My earlier post hinted at a jaw-dropping $4 billion in funding following a Data Republican exposé on England’s refugee crisis. But brace yourself—the truth is far darker. A deeper dive reveals the UNHCR has raked in over $21 BILLION, with a grand total of $23.74 BILLION from the U.S. Department of State, $7.60 MILLION from USAID, and $5.22 MILLION from HHS. These colossal sums, flowing since 2008 and culminating in a chilling final payment on January 1, 2025, fuel the shadowy GLOBAL RESETTLEMENT INITIATIVE. @SecRubio This needs to be investigated and unveiled who's behind the destruction of the West?

    Puerto Rico: Out of Sight, Out of Mind 

Here’s a glimpse into waste and fraud in Puerto Rico: Between 2021 and 2024, the federal government allocated approximately $6 million to LGBTQ and migrant programs in Puerto Rico. Note: This is based on a quick search and not an in-depth analysis. 

Additionally, the Department of Defense spent over $2 billion on temporary power generation on the Island.

    Department of Education:
On August 1, 2025, the Department of Education awarded Accenture Federal Services LLC a $168.1 million contract, potentially rising to $936.7 million, for managing Title IV financial aid origination, disbursement systems, and customer service transition services. This involves handling key aspects of federal student aid programs. Accenture Federal Services, known for its progressive corporate stance, has secured over $20 billion in government contracts and plays a significant role in various federal education initiatives across agencies Including the DOD 6.5 Billion Dollars.
What's concerning about this situation is that the company's Chief Strategy Officer "Bhaskar Ghosh" is an Indian national residing in India. This individual oversees the company's program strategy, which involves secret and top-secret contracts, allowing a foreign national to access all the sensitive data.
Additionally, look at the company donation from 2024.

    IOM Germany: On July 15, 2023, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Germany received a grant of $31.5 million to facilitate the processing of Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applications. However, concerns have been raised about the integrity of this process due to past issues. In 2010, the IOM was found to have falsified SIV and I-94 application documents, leading to the temporary suspension of the SIV program by the U.S. Department of State. Allegations suggest that the IOM charged applicants 10k to use authentic documents originally belonging to individuals who had worked with coalition forces, altering the names to facilitate immigration. 
I personally know five individuals from Iraq successfully immigrated to the United States through this method. Given this history, there are concerns that the recent funding to IOM Germany may involve processing unvetted Afghan applicants for U.S. entry. 
@DataRepublican just did a thread on this and how profitable illegal immigration is.

    Why is the U.S. government spending over $70 million on luxury Hyatt hotel rooms, especially given that the Pritzker family, with significant influence, holds a major stake in Hyatt Hotels Corporation?

By the way DOD takes the cake with overall spending with $51.8 million and just one contract for $16.9 Million between Jan 10, 2021 to Sep 30, 2021.

Pritzker Influence: The Pritzker family, with a 3.8% equity stake and 88.8% voting power in Hyatt Hotels Corporation, benefits indirectly from government contracts.

    Clinton Health Access Initiative Caught in the Crosshairs!
Chelsea Clinton’s fuming as RFK Jr. shakes up the vaccine game, exposing the Clinton Foundation’s shady schemes. A fiery Republican @DataRepublican  already roasted her, and we’re here to fan the flames! The Clinton Foundation’s pet project, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, is bleeding cash as reforms threaten to drain their piggy bank dry. 
Spilling the tea: they’ve been pocketing millions in grants, like $3.5M from the University of Nebraska (2021-2026), $1.05M from Duke via NASA (04/28/2025), and a whopping $14M+. Time to pull the plug on their grift!

    Clinton Health Access Initiative Caught in the Crosshairs!
Chelsea Clinton’s fuming as RFK Jr. shakes up the vaccine game, exposing the Clinton Foundation’s shady schemes. A fiery Republican @DataRepublican  already roasted her, and we’re here to fan the flames! The Clinton Foundation’s pet project, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, is bleeding cash as reforms threaten to drain their piggy bank dry. 
Spilling the tea: they’ve been pocketing millions in grants, like $3.5M from the University of Nebraska (2021-2026), $1.05M from Duke via NASA (04/28/2025), and a whopping $14M+. Time to pull the plug on their grift!

    NIH Racist Health Equity funding. 
On October 14, 2022, Pulse 2.0 reported that the University of Miami was awarded a $1.3 million grant to develop AI for addressing health disparities. This initiative is part of the university’s leadership in the NIH’s AIM-AHEAD program, focusing on AI and machine learning to promote health equity and researcher diversity. The grant supports collaboration with historically Black colleges, tribal colleges, and other minority-serving institutions to build a computing framework for sharing de-identified patient data, enhancing healthcare research quality and scope. 
The project is led by Azizi Seixas and Nicholas Tsinoremas. (Funding details in part two.)

To promote fiscal responsibility, government funding for NGOs like TreePeople Should be discontinued, as these organizations have the capacity to sustain themselves independently. Additionally, consideration should be given to requiring such nonprofits to contribute taxes, aligning with broader tax equity principles.

The contract was marked complete in February 2025, but only $15.8 million was disbursed. What happened to the remaining funds?

I’m raising this question because @TPASarah is conducting link analysis on the Taliban and Al-Qaeda movements within Afghanistan.

Additionally, I’d like an update on the status of the remaining funds allocated for contracts in Afghanistan. Specifically, what happened to the de-obligated amounts or funds from contracts terminated for convenience? Where did that money go?

    Child pornography victims are hindered by insufficient funding from the U.S. government.

The U.S. government spends trillions on various programs, including controversial contracts and funneling people into America, but allocates minimal funds, such as a mere $1,600 contract, to investigate cases involving suspected child pornography and unidentified victims.
This is absurd.

    The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is funding a pilot program to address fake PTSD among unaccompanied migrant teens. On May 9, 2023, HHS awarded a $1.4 million grant to The Trustees of Columbia University in New York City.
A prior study (CAMINANDO) with 74 Latino teens in NYC showed that exposure to violence and hunger correlated with poorer mental health and cognitive outcomes, but strong social networks post-resettlement aided coping. A new 18-month study (CAMINANDO-MENTAL HEALTH) with 400 teens is proposed to further explore and address these issues.

Another word B.S spending...

This program still ongoing.

    Brace yourself: the Department of Health and Human Services unleashed a staggering $107.5 million on a single contract with Retractable Technologies Inc. in Maryland, all to secure 1ml syringes paired with 25G x 1" needles for the COVID-19 fight, spanning February 2021 to February 2022. This is but one deal in a web of contracts! Consider this: each needle costs a mere $0.08–$0.20, yet Maryland, with its 6,180,253 souls in 2023 per the US Census Bureau, bore witness to this colossal expenditure. What secrets lie in the shadows of such a monumental investment?

I'm not a math expert. However, someone please do the math here on how many shots on an average everyone took in MD based on the numbers. 

This is money laundering operation...

MP Materials, tied to China's state-backed Shenghe Resources (8% stake), is cashing in on U.S. government contracts despite clear ties to the CCP. Shenghe buys rare earths from MP’s Mountain Pass Mine for processing in China, while the DOD and DOE funnel millions to MP, including:  
 $35M contract (2/17/2022)

Federal spending shows. On March 16, 2021, the ACF Office of Government Contracting Services awarded Family Endeavors, Inc. $529,533,833 for services supporting the ORR Unaccompanied Children's Program at a facility in Pecos, TX. On April 21, 2021, this amount increased to $795,357,967.25. 

Family Endeavors, Inc. received approximately $3 billion in taxpayer funds already for activities related to illegal immigration. 
PS they have an contract $3,329,900,356.98 started on 12/19/2024 and ends on 11/15/2025 83 million already spent and we can claw back the rest.

HHS 75 Billion dollars funding for Southwest Key Programs Inc.

@RyanMattaMedia gave me the name of this NGO They’re a nonprofit claiming running “shelters, education, housing, medical care  and reunification” for unaccompanied minors, funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ ORR, I found some funding receipts.   

Questions needs to be asked here:
1- Reuniting kids with WHO? Cartels? 
2- @MarioNawfal EXPOSED their crumbling shelters with proving reports and investigation of budlings lacking on basic services like showers and kitchens! 
3- Faking kid counts to STEAL taxpayer cash? 
4- Which government crooks are in on it?  

Since 2008, they’ve looted BILLIONS, allegedly under Obama’s orders, with Mayorkas plotting to CRASH America in a flood of illegals. And bring America to her Knees!  I found some receipts and it tracks with what Ryan investigate and it go's back all the way to 2008.

Below you will see one example of a recent grant for 75 Billion dollars. Another one for 22 millions for shelter and transportation services! 

PS the 75 Million Dollars contract still active till 2028.

    Exclusive Report Where Are the Kids?
 MVM Inc. DHS Funding. 

Following a tip from Ryan Matta, an independent journalist focused on NGOs and human trafficking, I investigated MVM Inc.’s government contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On March 31, 2020, MVM Inc. received $743,584,952.88 for Unaccompanied Alien Children and Family Units Transportation Services, later increased to $826,807,087.25. The contract was terminated on April 8, 2025.

The expenditure of over $826 million for transporting vulnerable populations raises serious concerns about oversight. Where are these kids? 

For transparency, the officials linked to this funding are Beth Davis (BETH.DAVIS@ICE.DHS.GOV), Pamela Odhiambo (PAMELA.ODHIAMBO@ICE.DHS.GOV), and JCapello7012. Given the implications for children, I felt it necessary to share the name and emails of those who been involved. Below is the receipts. 

Ps Over the years MVM Inc received over 3 billion dollars and spiked during the Biden admin. Below is the funding trends as well.

    Exclusive Look Into Linguistic Contracting Companies
The following is a comparison of U.S. government spending on American Sign Language (ASL) services versus two linguistic contracting companies. 

The first image shows the government's expenditure on ASL services dating back to 2008. The second image displays the spending on VALIANT INTEGRATED SERVICES LLC, which exceeds $5 billion.

 The third and fourth images present another linguistic company, Global Linguist Solutions LLC, with an amount surpassing $2.1 billion.

Note that the U.S. military and government employ a diverse workforce, including many foreign language-speaking service members. In the military, individuals who speak qualifying languages receive an additional $500 per month for each language. 

Government employees can also receive this amount, but only if their position is designated as language-enabled. For instance, despite working for the Army CI Command with a 3/3 DLPT score in Arabic and using my language skills for OSINT analysis, I was denied the extra pay because my billet was not classified as language-enabled. But the command hirs linguists to do just what i was doing. Complete waste of taxpayers money...   

PS This example of only 2 companies and dose not include Leidos, Booze Allen and many others.

This amount is actually peanuts giving the fact I started my career as an Arabic linguist and i know a lot about these type of contracts.

In 2010, the Obama Administration granted HILL & KNOWLTON STRATEGIES, LLC $1.2 million to support Phase #2 of President Obama’s "United We Serve" initiative. They later received an additional $705,000 for Phase #3. You can find the receipts below. 

This initiative kicked off in 2005, and the same company has been spearheading its strategy from the start. Interestingly, 2005 also marks the year Obama began rising to prominence. The Obama media psyop seems to have its roots back then.

    3 parts How the DC Swamp is Undermining @DOGE  and Crushing the Will of We the People  
Last night, while digging into some research, I stumbled upon a chilling pattern: key contracts are vanishing from the government spending database. I found several cases, but one stands out as critical—it’s tied to Michael Hayden, ex-CIA director and one of the 51 intel officials behind the Hunter Biden laptop letter. Hayden sits on the board of Freedom Technology Solution Group LLC (FTSG), a company neck-deep in NSA tech contracts.

    Old #Twitter Gov Funding Under #Jackdorsey
US Agency for Global Media AKA Voice of America Paid old Twitter over 400k in two different contracts.

1- May 01, 2020, $223,735 for DIGITAL SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING TWITTER
2- May 01, 2021, $217,314 for DIGITAL SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING TWITTER

One can only ask why these transactions took place. 
May 2020 COVID19 and election season started and we noticed Old Twitter start silencing decent and shifting the platform to far left hub 
In 2021 the US Gov start mandating the COVID19 Jab and silencing and all critics and promoting the Gov narrative and the far left and completely banning people accounts. 

For transparency I looked for new @X  #x under #elon ownership and I found nothing

So far, $9.8 million has been funded, and the contract could potentially increase to $36.4 million. Given this context, if you feel you were targeted due to your investigative work, I believe you might be onto something. These NGOs have clear motives to silence individuals like you who are working to expose their activities. Also there are more like these are still active...

He specifically pointed out the International Organization for Migration (IOM, also known as OIM), which is one and the same NGO. Let's take a closer look at the total funding this NGO receives—nearly $10 billion from the U.S. government. In the second picture, you'll notice when the funding spike began. The third picture shows some of their contracts, which, by the way, span across the globe. The fourth picture provides an example of one such contract, detailing lodging and transportation for illegal migrants in Africa, funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

    USIP Spending for fake Journalism
Are you familiar with an Agency called the United States Institute of Peace (USIP)? Yep Most people never heard of it 
It appears that this agency has largely remained under the public radar until recently. Upon conducting some research into their financial allocations, I discovered a contract among so many awarded to Eye Media Group on August 16, 2024, valued at $460,000. This contract, which is a continuation of prior agreements, pertains to the provision of Afghan journalist.
Additionally, I looked into Eye Media Group and they don't have a website and the linked in page is super vague
However, they have their own channel called Amu TV

1- Federal acquisition service 179 contract in small increment amounts 
2- AGRICULTUR department just one contract for 1.1 million to company called original pizza crust labeled as meat boxes in the description
3- NIH Over 40k on Pizza Ovens (Not Sure why NIH need Pizza Ovens) If this for the cafeteria then those are contracted out and the contractor is responsible for the equipment's.
We need to establish a Pizza taskforce to investigate farther.

The shocking thing when you look at the discerption it states that it's for "Advanced Battle Management Systems" But if you go to the company website you will find that they are a DEI training company, they have nothing to do with Warfighting technologies and here's their main page and under the opinion section you this "DEI is under attack and companies must fight back"

A court in Uzbekistan has convicted an Uzbek journalist, who reports for Voice of America, of three press-related crimes, fined him about $10,000, and then released him. Bobaev currently lives in Ukraine. 

PS the list of funding for independent content creators are over 100K line items just in the EU. This is just one example.

    Alert: Rep Greg Casar funding; After doing some digging here what I found. Rep Greg been imbedded with Unions. Those Unions been getting hefty contracts by the government.
Most of of Rep Casar funding comes from these Unions such as Building trade union they donated 64k in 2023 for his election also another notable one Service Employees International Union. 

Below is the breakdown and some contracts with the gov 

Additionally, he's been getting funded by these Unions since 2013 based on https://opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/greg-casar/summary?cid=N00049855…

No wonder why he's loosing his mind about Elon and Doge!

    Alert: Rep Greg Casar funding; After doing some digging here what I found. Rep Greg been imbedded with Unions. Those Unions been getting hefty contracts by the government.
Most of of Rep Casar funding comes from these Unions such as Building trade union they donated 64k in 2023 for his election also another notable one Service Employees International Union. 

Below is the breakdown and some contracts with the gov 

Additionally, he's been getting funded by these Unions since 2013 based on https://opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/greg-casar/summary?cid=N00049855…

No wonder why he's loosing his mind about Elon and Doge!

    Thread Today, I received a tip from a close associate whom I first met while working at the FBI Terrorist Screening Center in Vienna, Virginia, where she served as a contractor. Following that role, she secured another contract position with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) in Maryland. Most recently, she was employed by Celestar Corporation.

According to her, Celestar Corporation accused her of harassment—an allegation that appears to lack substantive basis or identifiable complainants. She also noted that Celestar Corporation presents itself as a small, veteran-owned business, yet it operates two subsidiary companies under a parent entity known as Celestar Holdings Corporation.

    NEW: Abigail Spanberger’s $50K CCP Donation Linked to Hunter Biden’s Beijing Benefactor

Campaign-finance filings show Virginia gubernatorial hopeful (and ex-CIA officer) Abigail Spanberger pocketed two $25,000 checks this spring from Pin Ni, president of Wanxiang America—a Chinese company whose founder was hailed as an “National Outstanding Communist Party Member.”   

Hunter Biden’s laptop ties the very same Pin Ni to the Biden family racket: 

Days after Ni met Joe Biden at the White House in July 2014, he emailed Hunter about fixing—and later upgrading—Hunter’s $142,000 Fisker sports car after Wanxiang bought the bankrupt EV maker. 

Spanberger brands herself a “national-security” expert, yet she’s cashing checks from the CCP middleman who cozied up to both Bidens while the laptop exposed their foreign-cash pipeline.  

This is Deep State royalty in living color: an Obama-era spy turned politician, now financed by the same Beijing-linked bagman who greased the Biden machine.  

Virginians don’t need another governor wired into Hunter’s hard-drive scandals—they need a firewall against communist cash and the swamp creatures who keep taking it.

    Amazon expose. Read the tip I received!
Steve,
It was good speaking with you the other day. I would like to write down how this Amazon thing is happening, but first need to put it into context how Amazon works.

Amazon allows third-party sellers to sell products on their website. This is not just their manufactured product, but products on Amazon from any brand. Third-party sellers represent 61% of Amazon's Marketplace. They had a revenue of 156 billion dollars in 2024. However, of all third-party sellers, almost half are from other countries. China, India, and Pakistan are some of where I see requests being made. That being said, the revenue they generate is being taken out of the US economy.

How are they doing this, you might ask. There are websites dedicated to teaching people in other countries how to set up businesses in the United States without ever being here. https://ecomera.us is one of them, based in Pakistan. They use registered agents in the US to set these businesses up and often use states with very little tax liability to avoid any tax being taken. 301 n gould st, Sheridan, WY, is one of the most common locations, but these are all over. They are in Florida and Texas as well and can provide where those most used are. Registered Agents Inc is one of the companies setting these companies up and as you see below they have many locations and also are setting businesses up that are creating scams.

https://registeredagentsinc.com/contact-us/

https://thesheridanpress.com/news/local/another-scam-recorded-from-business-related-to-30-n-gould-st-registered-agent/article_52b040ca-f622-11eb-a595-e7f2de685e62.html…

There is a lot to this, but this loophole needs to be closed at the federal government level. This is hurting our small businesses and our economy. This practice is being done on more than just Amazon. Walmart and eBay are also huge culprits.

Please let me know what other information you need me to elaborate on or provide more proof of. Thank you

    Department of Education:
On August 1, 2025, the Department of Education awarded Accenture Federal Services LLC a $168.1 million contract, potentially rising to $936.7 million, for managing Title IV financial aid origination, disbursement systems, and customer service transition services. This involves handling key aspects of federal student aid programs. Accenture Federal Services, known for its progressive corporate stance, has secured over $20 billion in government contracts and plays a significant role in various federal education initiatives across agencies Including the DOD 6.5 Billion Dollars.
What's concerning about this situation is that the company's Chief Strategy Officer "Bhaskar Ghosh" is an Indian national residing in India. This individual oversees the company's program strategy, which involves secret and top-secret contracts, allowing a foreign national to access all the sensitive data.
Additionally, look at the company donation from 2024.

On August 1, 2025, the Department of Education awarded Accenture Federal Services LLC a $168.1 million contract, potentially rising to $936.7 million, for managing Title IV financial aid origination, disbursement systems, and customer service transition services. This involves handling key aspects of federal student aid programs. Accenture Federal Services, known for its progressive corporate stance, has secured over $20 billion in government contracts and plays a significant role in various federal education initiatives across agencies Including the DOD 6.5 Billion Dollars.
What's concerning about this situation is that the company's Chief Strategy Officer "Bhaskar Ghosh" is an Indian national residing in India. This individual oversees the company's program strategy, which involves secret and top-secret contracts, allowing a foreign national to access all the sensitive data.
Additionally, look at the company donation from 2024.

(Check my attached graduation cert for the real deal.) Her only qualification? Her dad, a big-shot neocon tied to Reagan’s Iran-Contra scandal, where he brokered the arms-for-hostages deal. After that, he jumped to the American Enterprise Institute, a neocon hub pumping out Iraq and Afghanistan war propaganda. 
P.S. If you still in touch with her just ask her how many pages is the source validation forum.  
Ask @TPASarah I'm sure she's been to the same Intel courses I have.

    Jeffrey Epstein: I’m uncertain about how to approach this, but it’s time to share some truth. During my time in the intelligence community, I searched for Epstein-related files on the Top Secret Network, including JWICS, SION (the FBI’s top-secret database), and GOLD. I found no records in Datatree, CELLEX, XRY, DIA reporting, NSA Pules, or CIA Wires, except for a single Intelligence Information Report (IIR) from 2004, which was sparse. It’s possible the files were never digitized due to incomplete big data integration. I suspect most original files have been destroyed by now, and the FBI is being misled. Under 18 U.S.C. § 793, the government can destroy evidence without question.

And I can confirm that DIA is a hub of commies and extreme far left and I know bunch of them. Also there is a major reforms needs to take a place with ICD203.

    I received the following email from CODEPINK.

"We are writing to formally address and correct the false and defamatory statements made in your recent social media posts regarding CODEPINK. These claims—which falsely allege that our organization is funded by China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or any foreign government or entity—are entirely baseless and constitute libel." 

So, I will share the facts without spin: 

Per Wikipedia, CODEPINK is 25% funded by Neville Singham, who is living in Shanghai and got rich off spreading CCP propaganda, and is under investigation by Congress for FARA violations. 

CODEPINK is running a campaign called "China is Not Our Enemy," which promotes pro-China messaging, including denial of the Uyghur genocide, an atrocity affirmed by the U.S. Department of State.

The founder of CODEPINK, Jodie Evans, is married to the aforementioned Neville Singham. 

In fact, the Uyghur denialism goes so far that Jodie Evans said in a YouTube interview, that Uyghurs are terrorists trained in Yemen and Syria who bomb shopping centers.

reshared it to amplify it.  Here's my findings. Progress Action Fund (PAF) PAC was founded and lead by Joe Jacobson in August 2020  a former Obama administration alum.

Joe Jacobson Founded the below companies Couple of them received Gov funding directly: 
1- Joe Jacobson (McKinley Capital Management, LLC): Head of Private Equity at McKinley Alaska, with prior roles at McDowell Group and Huna Totem Corporation.

2- Joe Jacobson (Jacobson Technologies): President with experience in software and system development since 1989.  3- Joe Jacobson (Jacobson Press P.C.): President and trial attorney in St. Louis, previously with Green Jacobson, P.C., focusing on civil litigation and business disputes.  

3- Joseph Jacobson (MIT Media Lab): Founder of E Ink Corporation, Gen9, Inc., and Kovio, and a professor at MIT, known for inventing E Ink technology.  

4- Joe Jacobsen (Jacobsen Holz Corp.): President, Founder, and CEO of this company.  

PS this is the important part. Joseph Jacobson (MIT Media Lab):  Gen9, Inc., and a professor at MIT, known for inventing E Ink technology.   MIT Media Lab received and obligated amount for for 2 million dollars from NASA in which 1.5 already dispersed and still 6 month left into this project.  

 Also, Gen9, Inc., received 1.36 millions between 2014 and 2016 from the Department of Commerce (DOC).   He started his PAC based on his direct benefits of gov contracts and Tax payers fundings.

The below video is been advertised on social media and @RepSwalwell reshared it to amplify it. 
Here's my findings. Progress Action Fund (PAF) PAC was founded and lead by Joe Jacobson in August 2020  a former Obama administration alum. It focuses on producing and running hard-hitting advertisements to defeat Republican candidates in swing districts and support liberal Democrats in competitive "red to blue" races. PAF is known for its aggressive, viral ad campaigns, such as “Keep Republicans Out Of Your Bedroom” and “Republicans Watching Your Daughter,” which aim to hold Republicans accountable and shape political narratives.

The U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) allocated fake $40,000 to a counter-narcotics program in Afghanistan, the world's leading opium producer. This amount seems negligible for tackling such a massive issue, raising questions about its effectiveness. Was this funding merely a cover for intelligence operations, which typically aren't logged in federal spending records? 
Or they Just paid a local podcaster to make failed videos that no one watches?

    You may want to look into his company.  Mike Pompeo, Brian Bulatao, Ulrich Brechbuhl, or Michael Stradinger—the West Point classmates who co-founded Thayer Aerospace (later Nex-Tech Aerospace)—some of these individuals, particularly Pompeo and Bulatao, later held roles in government that involved significant interaction with the intelligence community, which has fueled speculation about earlier connections. Keep in mind State&CIA are interchangeable 

Mike Pompeo
Background: A 1986 West Point graduate, Pompeo served as a cavalry officer in the U.S. Army until 1991, including patrols along the Iron Curtain. He attended Harvard Law, worked as a lawyer before co-founding Thayer Aerospace.

Pompeo served as Director of the CIA (2017–2018) he was Secretary of State (2018–2021), 
•Speculation:  His rapid rise in politics and Koch Industries’ investment in Thayer as circumstantial evidence.
•Koch Connection: Thayer Aerospace received significant funding from Koch Industries, a conglomerate with ties to libertarian and conservative political networks. Some speculative narratives allege Koch-funded ventures indirectly intersect with intelligence interests due to their political influence.

Brian Bulatao
•Background: A West Point classmate of Pompeo’s, Bulatao co-founded Thayer Aerospace and served as its chief operating officer. He later joined Pompeo in founding Sentry International, an oilfield equipment company, in 1998. Pompeo and big oil and Ukraine/Russia. !!!
•Bulatao served as Under Secretary of State for Management (2018–2021) under Pompeo, a role involving oversight of State Department operations, including security and coordination with intelligence agencies (CIA belly button). He was also briefly the Chief Operating Officer of the CIA during Pompeo’s tenure as director which is the gatekeeping #3 job, a position directly tied to the agency’s operational management.

Ulrich Brechbuhl
•Background: Another West Point classmate, Brechbuhl co-founded Thayer Aerospace but left the company early to pursue other ventures. He later worked as a lawyer and executive, including at Bank of America. Notorious for money laundering CIA operations. 
•Later Intelligence Ties: Brechbuhl served as Counselor of the State Department (2018–2021) under Pompeo, a senior advisory role that involves strategic and diplomatic issues, including coordination with intelligence agencies. During his tenure, he was involved in controversial actions, such as accompanying Pompeo to Ukraine in 2019 amid the Trump impeachment inquiry, which drew scrutiny for potential intelligence-related implications. Again, Ukraine. 

Michael Stradinger
•Background: The least publicly documented of the four, Stradinger was a West Point classmate who co-founded Thayer Aerospace but left early. Little is known about his subsequent career, as he has maintained a low public profile.

On April 21, 2025, the FBI awarded $484,888.23 to Business Management Research Associates, Inc. for podcast sessions covering the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).

    The Shocking Walt Disney-U.S. Army Scandal: Shades of Green Program at Walt Disney World Resort
In a jaw-dropping revelation, the U.S. Army has funneled millions of taxpayer dollars into a shadowy program known as Shades of Green at Walt Disney World Resort. 

At the peak of the 2021 government shutdown, when the nation was paralyzed and the resort stood eerily silent, the Army brazenly poured $1,947,543.73 into this enigmatic initiative. But the plot thickens—on June 15, 2020, the FBI quietly diverted $49,091.00 to the same cause. 

For years, this clandestine program has siphoned off vast sums of public funds, leaving a trail of questions and a haunting truth: millions spent, with nothing to show for it.

    Mercedes-Benz's Jaw-Dropping Government Cash Grab!

I thought the mainstream media said they government spending money on tesla's?   

Buckle up for a wild ride! A shocking investigation I Just Uncovered over $135 MILLION funneled into Mercedes-Benz deals in North America, with THE ARMORED GROUP LLC raking in the lion’s share! Just check this out: on April 3, 2025, they pocketed a cool $9,515,920 for Armored Sprinter Model 4500s.

 And as if that wasn’t enough, they scored another $20,436,922 just 12 days later on April 15, 2025! That’s right—$135 MILLION+ in taxpayer dollars flowing straight to THE ARMORED GROUP LLC for their luxe Mercedes-Benz armored beasts. What’s the real cost of this high-roller spending spree? You won’t believe it! 

More to come on the Benz luxury spending...

    LTG. Flynn Story Time
Most people know LTG Michael Flynn from the FBI ambush during the first Trump Administration, but few are aware of his critical role in stabilizing Iraq in 2008. From 2007 to 2008, I served in Basra, Iraq, with ODA 5332, 5th Special Forces Group, helping establish the 6th Iraqi Special Operations Battalion to operate in southern Iraq.

During this period, LTG John F. Mulholland Jr. (Special Forces) took command of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force (CJSOTF) following a major restructuring in CENTCOM’s area of responsibility. MG Flynn then, who served as Director of Intelligence for the Joint Special Operations Command from July 2004 to June 2007, then became Director of Intelligence for U.S. Central Command from June 2007 to July 2008. He provided strategic guidance to LTG Mulholland on counterinsurgency tactics, overcoming the repeated setbacks under GEN Casey.

By May 2008, we executed the pivotal operation "Charge of the Knights," which effectively dismantled insurgency activities in the region until policy shifts under the Obama Administration in 2010 destabilized Iraq and the broader region by 2011. LTG Flynn’s deep expertise in global threats and unwavering dedication to America are often overlooked. He is a true patriot and hero.

    Part 6: Where Are the Kids?
Federal spending shows. On March 16, 2021, the ACF Office of Government Contracting Services awarded Family Endeavors, Inc. $529,533,833 for services supporting the ORR Unaccompanied Children's Program at a facility in Pecos, TX. On April 21, 2021, this amount increased to $795,357,967.25. 

Family Endeavors, Inc. received approximately $3 billion in taxpayer funds already for activities related to illegal immigration. 
PS they have an contract $3,329,900,356.98 started on 12/19/2024 and ends on 11/15/2025 83 million already spent and we can claw back the rest.

    Part 3: Exclusive Report Where Are the Kids?
HHS 75 Billion dollars funding for Southwest Key Programs Inc.

@RyanMattaMedia gave me the name of this NGO They’re a nonprofit claiming running “shelters, education, housing, medical care  and reunification” for unaccompanied minors, funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ ORR, I found some funding receipts.   

Questions needs to be asked here:
1- Reuniting kids with WHO? Cartels? 
2- @MarioNawfal EXPOSED their crumbling shelters with proving reports and investigation of budlings lacking on basic services like showers and kitchens! 
3- Faking kid counts to STEAL taxpayer cash? 
4- Which government crooks are in on it?  

Since 2008, they’ve looted BILLIONS, allegedly under Obama’s orders, with Mayorkas plotting to CRASH America in a flood of illegals. And bring America to her Knees!  I found some receipts and it tracks with what Ryan investigate and it go's back all the way to 2008.

Below you will see one example of a recent grant for 75 Billion dollars. Another one for 22 millions for shelter and transportation services! 

PS the 75 Million Dollars contract still active till 2028.

    Exclusive Report Where Are the Kids?
 MVM Inc. DHS Funding. 

Following a tip from Ryan Matta, an independent journalist focused on NGOs and human trafficking, I investigated MVM Inc.’s government contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On March 31, 2020, MVM Inc. received $743,584,952.88 for Unaccompanied Alien Children and Family Units Transportation Services, later increased to $826,807,087.25. The contract was terminated on April 8, 2025.

The expenditure of over $826 million for transporting vulnerable populations raises serious concerns about oversight. Where are these kids? 

For transparency, the officials linked to this funding are Beth Davis (BETH.DAVIS@ICE.DHS.GOV), Pamela Odhiambo (PAMELA.ODHIAMBO@ICE.DHS.GOV), and JCapello7012. Given the implications for children, I felt it necessary to share the name and emails of those who been involved. Below is the receipts. 

Ps Over the years MVM Inc received over 3 billion dollars and spiked during the Biden admin. Below is the funding trends as well.

    Hello Michiganders: 
Crazy Redhead’s Bid for a Senate Seat in Michigan Raises Eyebrows!
Before politics, she designed for Mazda, pocketing $8M in taxpayer-funded contracts.
Then, she crafted toys for Mattel, cozy with China’s supply chains.
And at Gawker Media? She rubbed shoulders with Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, whose firm funneled cash to save the site from @HulkHogan $100M lawsuit.
From corporate deals to foreign ties, is this candidate’s past too wild for the Senate?
Also her Husband is worked at Gawker and he was Sr editor and chief and staffer for presidential candidate John Kerry. 
This woman is deep state as deep state gets. And if you live in Michigan you need need to ask yourself one question is she for you or against you. After this post you should know the facts.

    Hello Michiganders: 
Crazy Redhead’s Bid for a Senate Seat in Michigan Raises Eyebrows!
Before politics, she designed for Mazda, pocketing $8M in taxpayer-funded contracts.
Then, she crafted toys for Mattel, cozy with China’s supply chains.
And at Gawker Media? She rubbed shoulders with Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, whose firm funneled cash to save the site from @HulkHogan $100M lawsuit.
From corporate deals to foreign ties, is this candidate’s past too wild for the Senate?
Also her Husband is worked at Gawker and he was Sr editor and chief and staffer for presidential candidate John Kerry. 
This woman is deep state as deep state gets. And if you live in Michigan you need need to ask yourself one question is she for you or against you. After this post you should know the facts.

    Obama Media Psyop Funding 
As I mentioned last night, I promised to share this post this morning, and here it is. 
In 2010, the Obama Administration granted HILL & KNOWLTON STRATEGIES, LLC $1.2 million to support Phase #2 of President Obama’s "United We Serve" initiative. They later received an additional $705,000 for Phase #3. You can find the receipts below. 

This initiative kicked off in 2005, and the same company has been spearheading its strategy from the start. Interestingly, 2005 also marks the year Obama began rising to prominence. The Obama media psyop seems to have its roots back then.

    3 parts How the DC Swamp is Undermining @DOGE  and Crushing the Will of We the People  
Last night, while digging into some research, I stumbled upon a chilling pattern: key contracts are vanishing from the government spending database. I found several cases, but one stands out as critical—it’s tied to Michael Hayden, ex-CIA director and one of the 51 intel officials behind the Hunter Biden laptop letter. Hayden sits on the board of Freedom Technology Solution Group LLC (FTSG), a company neck-deep in NSA tech contracts.

    Urgent Update on Signal App Debacle and US Gov funding By US Agency for Global Media AKA VOA. 
The media loosing their mind and making this a bigger story than what it seems. What they failed to mention is Signal was government funded secure communication app and they have backdoor access to every text message. 
Signal originated from Whisper Systems, founded in 2010 by Moxie Marlinspike and Stuart Anderson. Their TextSecure and RedPhone apps, for encrypted texting and calls, merged into Signal by 2014 after Marlinspike formed Open Whisper Systems in 2013, post a Twitter acquisition in 2011. The Signal Protocol powers its respected end-to-end encryption.

Signal’s link to intelligence agencies stems from funding Open Whisper Systems got about $3 million from 2013 to 2016 from the Open Technology Fund (OTF), a U.S. government-backed group tied to Radio Free Asia (RFA). RFA, once CIA-funded in the 1950s, is now under the U.S. Agency for Global Media, supporting "internet freedom" tools for activists, aligning with U.S. policy.
Below you will see the total funding for OTF through out the years by USAGM and also some software contracts that allows the US gov to archive the cloud for WhatsApp and Signal. 
PS All congress members uses Signal for secure communication 
Please if you read this reshare it to get the truth out.

2- May 01, 2021, $217,314 for DIGITAL SOCIAL MEDIA ADVERTISING TWITTER

One can only ask why these transactions took place. 
May 2020 COVID19 and election season started and we noticed Old Twitter start silencing decent and shifting the platform to far left hub 
In 2021 the US Gov start mandating the COVID19 Jab and silencing and all critics and promoting the Gov narrative and the far left and completely banning people accounts.

However, USAID ALONE  funneled over 38 billion dollars to Ukraine between Jan 2021 and Jan 2025.

    Slaughter In SyriaOn 8 December 2024, the Assad regime collapsed during a major offensive by opposition forces. The offensive was spearheaded by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and supported mainly by the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army as part of the ongoing Syrian civil war that began with the Syrian revolution in 2011.

That's the media narrative. 

Truth: Between 2013 and 2025 the USAID and State Department spent over 6 billion dollars supporting the Al Assad regime opposition through shell companies and left wing NGO's.

    Alert: Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Hollywood Connection. 
Kvartal 95, the Ukrainian entertainment company co-founded by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is primarily based in Kyiv. Their official site, http://kvartal95.com

Back in 2016, Zelenskyy told Prensario International that Kvartal 95 had agents working in Los Angeles and plans for a European agency, hinting at ambitions to expand westward. This aligns with their international push—think Servant of the People landing on Netflix and deals with Eccho Rights for global distribution. LA, being a hub for entertainment, makes sense as a touchpoint for such moves, but it’s more about representation than a physical HQ. Event listings, like a 2017 "Kvartal 95 New Show" at 4401 W 8th St, LA (from http://eventcartel.com), show they’ve performed there, likely tapping into the Ukrainian diaspora or comedy fans. These gigs don’t scream "relocation"—they’re one-offs, not a sign of moving operations.

Kvartal 95’s output includes movies like I, You, He, She (2018) and TV comedies like Svaty, with a focus on Russian- and Ukrainian-language content for broad appeal in the region. Before politics, Zelenskyy was its artistic director (2003-2011) and a key producer, leveraging partnerships with channels like 1+1, owned by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. Financially, it’s estimated to generate around $30 million annually, with Zelenskyy holding a 25% stake—valued at roughly $11 million by Forbes Ukraine in 2022—though he transferred his shares to partners like Serhiy Shefir upon entering office.

Who is Ihor Kolomoisky:
He is a Ukrainian oligarch, born February 13, 1963, in Dnipro (then Dnipropetrovsk), Soviet Ukraine. He’s a billionaire—Forbes pegged his net worth at $1 billion in 2021, down from $2.4 billion in 2014—known for wielding wealth, media, and political clout.

When I served In Germany and Zelensky came to visit Wiesbaden the SAG-U HQ and USAREUR-AF Gen. Darryl Williams at the time made everyone at the base to come out to greet Zelenskyy and cheer for him. 
Here's some pictures to go back to the memory lane 
FYI Gen. Cavoli is not a big fan of him and Gen. Williams was kissing ass and simpping

    Wasteful Ukraine Spending: In light of what just happened and how Volodymyr Zelenskyy disrespected the Oval Office I figured I help the administration a kick stars the audit on the Ukraine spending. Here's some absurd funding for local employee life insurance by the state department and social media funding for local streamers and healthcare for local staff, and one for 2.7 million it just says ADD $. 
PS the list is long and shady line items are endless.

Al Hurra News Channel was founded in Feb 2004. Alhurra's headquarters are in Springfield, Virginia. The network also maintains bureaus in Baghdad and Dubai, production centers in Beirut, Jerusalem, Cairo, Rabat, Erbil and Washington, D.C., as well as correspondents throughout the Middle East, North Africa, the United States and Europe.
In Sep 2004 The USAGM gave the first payment through of 48,500$ through OXFORD RESEARCH INT'L LTD. Then the payments kept flowing. The screen shoot bellow highlight the total transactions throughout the years. 
Also, pay attention to the language in the item description box.
P.S. I only searched by the exact name. Sometimes they put different spelling for reasons caused by human errors or something more nefarious.

    USAID funneled $53 million to EcoHealth Alliance, which then used U.S. taxpayer funds to support gain-of-function research on coronaviruses at the Wuhan lab—research that likely led to the creation of COVID-19.

The CIA’s deception regarding COVID-19 origins becomes much clearer when considering USAID's long history of serving as a CIA front organization.

With an annual budget exceeding $50 billion and activities in over 100 countries, USAID has repeatedly been linked to intelligence activities. Former USAID Director John Gilligan once admitted the agency was “infiltrated from top to bottom with CIA people,” explaining that “the idea was to plant operatives in every kind of activity we had overseas: government, volunteer, religious, every kind.”

In 2013, a U.S. cable published by WikiLeaks outlined the U.S. strategy to undermine Venezuela’s government through USAID by "penetrating Chavez’s political base," "dividing Chavismo," and "isolating Chavez internationally." 

In 2014, the Associated Press revealed that USAID funded the creation of a Twitter-like platform intended to incite a rebellion in Cuba.

USAID funding has been linked to coups in Haiti, Ukraine, Egypt, and other nations.

From 2009 to 2019, USAID partnered with EcoHealth Alliance on the PREDICT program, which identified 1,200 new viruses, trained 5,000 people globally in disease detection, and enhanced 60 research labs.

This partnership provided the CIA with a direct channel for embedding human assets within biological research facilities worldwide in exchange for funding and technology transfers.

In 2022, Dr. Andrew Huff, a former Vice President at EcoHealth Alliance, publicly revealed Dr. Peter Daszak’s alleged ties to the CIA.

The core issue? 

The CIA lied to the American public about COVID-19’s origins because acknowledging the truth would expose its likely role in funneling taxpayer money through USAID to finance gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab.

    Hello @ShawnRyan762, This political appointee is clueless, propped up as Deputy Assistant for the Middle East at DoD despite zero training in intelligence analysis no DIA-ICD203 "Pace" course or ODNI Analysis 101. (Check my attached graduation cert for the real deal.) Her only qualification? Her dad, a big-shot neocon tied to Reagan’s Iran-Contra scandal, where he brokered the arms-for-hostages deal. After that, he jumped to the American Enterprise Institute, a neocon hub pumping out Iraq and Afghanistan war propaganda. 
P.S. If you still in touch with her just ask her how many pages is the source validation forum.  
Ask @TPASarah I'm sure she's been to the same Intel courses I have.

I'm going to share cases of property next to nuclear research facilities, sophisticated networks and strategies used, and how we can actually address this problem.

The "Educated Manticore" group (aka APT42, Charming Kitten, Mint Sandstorm) - linked directly to Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps Intelligence Organization - is using AI to craft perfect emails targeting Israeli cybersecurity professors and tech experts.
Zero typos, flawless grammar, professional tone - completely indistinguishable from legitimate communication. But some sharp targets caught tiny details like name mismatches in email headers.

    I received the following email from CODEPINK.

"We are writing to formally address and correct the false and defamatory statements made in your recent social media posts regarding CODEPINK. These claims—which falsely allege that our organization is funded by China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), or any foreign government or entity—are entirely baseless and constitute libel." 

So, I will share the facts without spin: 

Per Wikipedia, CODEPINK is 25% funded by Neville Singham, who is living in Shanghai and got rich off spreading CCP propaganda, and is under investigation by Congress for FARA violations. 

CODEPINK is running a campaign called "China is Not Our Enemy," which promotes pro-China messaging, including denial of the Uyghur genocide, an atrocity affirmed by the U.S. Department of State.

The founder of CODEPINK, Jodie Evans, is married to the aforementioned Neville Singham. 

In fact, the Uyghur denialism goes so far that Jodie Evans said in a YouTube interview, that Uyghurs are terrorists trained in Yemen and Syria who bomb shopping centers.

    Fog  of War: If anyone say Israel used October 7th for additional agenda then read the below It will give you a pretty good historical background.  

Subject: Historical Overview of Iran’s Nuclear Program

This post provides a concise, factual overview of Iran’s nuclear program from a historical perspective, focusing on its origins and development. The content is presented neutrally, without reference to specific geopolitical interests or recent events involving other nations.

1- Origins and Development of Iran’s Nuclear Program
 Iran’s nuclear program was initiated in the 1950s under the Shah’s regime, with support from the United States through the "Atoms for Peace" initiative. The Tehran Research Reactor, supplied by the U.S., became operational in 1967, marking the program’s early focus on civilian nuclear energy. Plans were established for multiple nuclear power plants to meet domestic energy needs. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the      program was temporarily halted but resumed in the 1980s, with Iran seeking partnerships with countries such as Russia and China. In the 2000s, Iran      intensified its uranium enrichment activities, particularly at facilities like Natanz, which sparked international concerns regarding the potential dual use nature of its nuclear capabilities.

2- Significant Disruption of Enrichment Activities
In 2010, Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility experienced a significant setback due to a cyberattack involving a sophisticated computer virus known as Stuxnet. The malware targeted the control systems of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment, causing malfunctions that disrupted operations. Widely regarded as a landmark event in cyber warfare, the attack is estimated to have delayed Iran’s nuclear program by one to two years. While the origins of Stuxnet remain unconfirmed by official sources, it has been extensively analyzed in reports, including those by major publications like The New York Times.

3- Historical Context of International Concerns
The development of Iran’s nuclear program over decades has drawn significant international attention, particularly regarding its enrichment capabilities. The program’s progression from civilian energy goals to      advanced enrichment activities has been a focal point of global diplomatic and security discussions, reflecting long-standing concerns about nuclear proliferation.

PS. Israel been trying to take out Iran nuclear capability for decades

The operation focused on IRGC leaders, senior officials in Iran's nuclear program, and military leadership. Israeli Intelligence revealed Iran's advanced efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, noting they were nearing success. The IDF spokesperson stated that months of intelligence work enabled precise strikes on key targets across Iran to ensure Israel's security.

    U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) meddling in Iran affairs.
Between August 2019 and  2021 USAGM Paid $135,850 to a firm in Northern VA  for media access and consumption patterns, the scope of domestic and international media outlets for Iran. 
Do you guys know what also happened in Iran shortly after that? 
In Nov 15 2019 riots erupted in Iran as well. It was reported in the media that the riots started because the gas prices increased.

    Update on the recipient of this DOD contract in Iran. 
The company based in Iraq who received the money.  GOLDEN HANDS PRIVATE COMPANY FOR TRADING & GENERAL CONTRACTING, LTD. Located in AL-HURYAH 50 MT ST BLDG 8 BAGHDAD, IRAQ. With No history of contracting with the U.S. Gov except this contract we need to ask questions here. 
P.S. Al- Huryah district is just outside of Al Kadhimiya and its heavy Shia 'at dominated district. 
DOD hiring an Iraqi company that was established in Aug 2021 to only preform one contract starting in 2024 in Iran sound pretty shady.

    Why does China own stake in USA REE Mine in California? This must Change @realDonaldTrump @JDVance @SecRubio @SecScottBessent @DavidSacks @DefiyantlyFree @ChinaUncensored @committeeonccp @ChrisHarrisADG @StealthMedical1 @GrantCardone @TVMohandasPai @MargoinWNC @WhiteHouse 

The Mountain Pass Mine in California, owned by MP Materials, is the only significant rare earth element (REE) mine in the United States. It produces about 15% of the world’s REEs, extracting minerals like neodymium, cerium, and lanthanum from bastnäsite ore. 

Historically, due to the lack of domestic processing facilities, the mine has shipped its rare earth concentrate to China for further processing, particularly to refiners like Shenghe Resources, a Chinese company that also holds a stake in MP Materials. This arrangement stems from China’s dominance in REE processing, handling nearly 90% of global supply, while the U.S. has limited capacity for separating and refining these elements.

Since 2017, MP Materials has been working to restore domestic processing capabilities. As of 2023, the company began separating light REEs at Mountain Pass, with plans to process neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide and, with Department of Defense funding, heavy REEs like dysprosium and terbium. 

However, full domestic processing without Chinese involvement has faced delays, and some concentrate is still sent to China. The mine’s operations are seen as critical for reducing U.S. reliance on Chinese supply chains, especially for defense and clean energy technologies, but challenges like environmental regulations and high processing costs persist. @grok verify this.

    Hello Michiganders: 
Crazy Redhead’s Bid for a Senate Seat in Michigan Raises Eyebrows!
Before politics, she designed for Mazda, pocketing $8M in taxpayer-funded contracts.
Then, she crafted toys for Mattel, cozy with China’s supply chains.
And at Gawker Media? She rubbed shoulders with Russian oligarch Viktor Vekselberg, whose firm funneled cash to save the site from @HulkHogan $100M lawsuit.
From corporate deals to foreign ties, is this candidate’s past too wild for the Senate?
Also her Husband is worked at Gawker and he was Sr editor and chief and staffer for presidential candidate John Kerry. 
This woman is deep state as deep state gets. And if you live in Michigan you need need to ask yourself one question is she for you or against you. After this post you should know the facts.

    Translation to this Hamas flyer below  

Inform those who to the patient, and who are struck by disaster and say, "Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return."

To my dear Gaza people. After the events that took place and the temporary ceasefire. And before starting to implementation of Trump’s cease-fire plan. Which will force your displacement what are you like it or not?
 Therefore, we have decided to address you with a final appeal to whomever  wants to assist us and we will not hesitate to assist in return. 

Reimagining the map of the world will not change. Even if all the people of Gaza disappeared. From existence, no one will feel you. No one will be happy about your value and your unity. In your inevitable fate, Iran cannot protect itself, let alone protect you. You have seen with your own eyes what happened to America and Europe. Gaza means nothing to them. Not even your Arabic allies countries who supply the oil, money and weapons but the send you coffins . There is little left to this game and it will be over 
Last but not least. Whomever wants to redeem himself before it’s too late. We are here before the end of times.

@StealthMedical1 @angertab @PeteHegseth @DNIGabbard @TulsiGabbard 

You need to get a hold on this asap

"China definitely has the technology and herds of manufacturing prowess. They know how to make stuff fast. They know how to make it cheap. They have automated cruise missile production facilities that are capable of turning out more cruise missiles in a week than the entire United States turns out in a year."

@DataRepublican did a massive thread on The 2025 May Day trip of SLC Armed Queers to Cuba: "Well, if we're terrorists, we're proud to be terrorists" And how the Obama Admin funded that. This extended beyond Obama throughout the years through the state department.   
Here's some gov funding for these so called cultural efforts. 
1- Government funding supports bilingual and cultural programs at the embassy, offering English language instruction and leadership training to at-risk Cuban undergraduate students, alongside lessons introducing them to U.S. culture, history, and values.

2-A one-week cultural exchange program featuring musician, singer, and songwriter Robert Glasper, a seven-time Grammy winner who received the 2023 Grammy for Best R&B Album, combining entrepreneurship training with cultural engagement.

    Fog  of War: If anyone say Israel used October 7th for additional agenda then read the below It will give you a pretty good historical background.  

Subject: Historical Overview of Iran’s Nuclear Program

This post provides a concise, factual overview of Iran’s nuclear program from a historical perspective, focusing on its origins and development. The content is presented neutrally, without reference to specific geopolitical interests or recent events involving other nations.

1- Origins and Development of Iran’s Nuclear Program
 Iran’s nuclear program was initiated in the 1950s under the Shah’s regime, with support from the United States through the "Atoms for Peace" initiative. The Tehran Research Reactor, supplied by the U.S., became operational in 1967, marking the program’s early focus on civilian nuclear energy. Plans were established for multiple nuclear power plants to meet domestic energy needs. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the      program was temporarily halted but resumed in the 1980s, with Iran seeking partnerships with countries such as Russia and China. In the 2000s, Iran      intensified its uranium enrichment activities, particularly at facilities like Natanz, which sparked international concerns regarding the potential dual use nature of its nuclear capabilities.

2- Significant Disruption of Enrichment Activities
In 2010, Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility experienced a significant setback due to a cyberattack involving a sophisticated computer virus known as Stuxnet. The malware targeted the control systems of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment, causing malfunctions that disrupted operations. Widely regarded as a landmark event in cyber warfare, the attack is estimated to have delayed Iran’s nuclear program by one to two years. While the origins of Stuxnet remain unconfirmed by official sources, it has been extensively analyzed in reports, including those by major publications like The New York Times.

3- Historical Context of International Concerns
The development of Iran’s nuclear program over decades has drawn significant international attention, particularly regarding its enrichment capabilities. The program’s progression from civilian energy goals to      advanced enrichment activities has been a focal point of global diplomatic and security discussions, reflecting long-standing concerns about nuclear proliferation.

PS. Israel been trying to take out Iran nuclear capability for decades

    Senator Graham stated "This isn’t a travel expense report. It’s a monthly contract between the State Department for U.S. diplomats in a war zone — nothing to do with my trip." 
The hotel expenses for June 2025 total $814,806, comprising $411,634 and $403,172. 
A comparison with prior months shows May 2025 expenses at $396,154 and $387,950, totaling $784,104; April 2025 had no reported expenses; and March 2025 expenses were $597,740 and $6,776, totaling $604,516.

Why have hotel expenses been lower in previous months? Are Senator Lindsey Graham's hotel costs included in the Department of State's monthly expenses, or has the U.S. increased its personnel presence in Ukraine? Either scenario raises concerns.

    You may want to look into his company.  Mike Pompeo, Brian Bulatao, Ulrich Brechbuhl, or Michael Stradinger—the West Point classmates who co-founded Thayer Aerospace (later Nex-Tech Aerospace)—some of these individuals, particularly Pompeo and Bulatao, later held roles in government that involved significant interaction with the intelligence community, which has fueled speculation about earlier connections. Keep in mind State&CIA are interchangeable 

Mike Pompeo
Background: A 1986 West Point graduate, Pompeo served as a cavalry officer in the U.S. Army until 1991, including patrols along the Iron Curtain. He attended Harvard Law, worked as a lawyer before co-founding Thayer Aerospace.

Pompeo served as Director of the CIA (2017–2018) he was Secretary of State (2018–2021), 
•Speculation:  His rapid rise in politics and Koch Industries’ investment in Thayer as circumstantial evidence.
•Koch Connection: Thayer Aerospace received significant funding from Koch Industries, a conglomerate with ties to libertarian and conservative political networks. Some speculative narratives allege Koch-funded ventures indirectly intersect with intelligence interests due to their political influence.

Brian Bulatao
•Background: A West Point classmate of Pompeo’s, Bulatao co-founded Thayer Aerospace and served as its chief operating officer. He later joined Pompeo in founding Sentry International, an oilfield equipment company, in 1998. Pompeo and big oil and Ukraine/Russia. !!!
•Bulatao served as Under Secretary of State for Management (2018–2021) under Pompeo, a role involving oversight of State Department operations, including security and coordination with intelligence agencies (CIA belly button). He was also briefly the Chief Operating Officer of the CIA during Pompeo’s tenure as director which is the gatekeeping #3 job, a position directly tied to the agency’s operational management.

Ulrich Brechbuhl
•Background: Another West Point classmate, Brechbuhl co-founded Thayer Aerospace but left the company early to pursue other ventures. He later worked as a lawyer and executive, including at Bank of America. Notorious for money laundering CIA operations. 
•Later Intelligence Ties: Brechbuhl served as Counselor of the State Department (2018–2021) under Pompeo, a senior advisory role that involves strategic and diplomatic issues, including coordination with intelligence agencies. During his tenure, he was involved in controversial actions, such as accompanying Pompeo to Ukraine in 2019 amid the Trump impeachment inquiry, which drew scrutiny for potential intelligence-related implications. Again, Ukraine. 

Michael Stradinger
•Background: The least publicly documented of the four, Stradinger was a West Point classmate who co-founded Thayer Aerospace but left early. Little is known about his subsequent career, as he has maintained a low public profile.

    Mike Pompeo Ukraine Visit: 
According to reports, Mike Pompeo is currently in Ukraine. I reviewed his post-office travels and found records of a 2023 trip with $11,830 in accommodation BELGIUM. Now I'm looking to see if the state department will log his visit properly and if taxpayers paid for the Ukraine trip. 

If you recall that @GenFlynn faced accusations of violating the Logan Act as part of an incoming administration. Meanwhile, others travel globally, engaging in undisclosed deals, yet face no accountability."

    As promised, here’s the list of Lindsey Graham’s travel expenses over the years. Note that most trips are recorded as Department of State hotel expenses without specific details. By cross-referencing, you can deduce that when politicians travel, the State Department logs the expenses. If you know of any representative or senator traveling outside the United States, let me know, and I’ll track the associated costs.

There is more I will be releasing at the appropriate time when the time comes. Stay Tuned.
Also If your congress member/ senator flying overseas let me know and i will find the trip cost.

    As promised, here’s the list of Lindsey Graham’s travel expenses over the years. Note that most trips are recorded as Department of State hotel expenses without specific details. By cross-referencing, you can deduce that when politicians travel, the State Department logs the expenses. If you know of any representative or senator traveling outside the United States, let me know, and I’ll track the associated costs.

There is more I will be releasing at the appropriate time when the time comes. Stay Tuned.
Also If your congress member/ senator flying overseas let me know and i will find the trip cost.

    Department of State Pride Month Spending in Guyana.

In 2021, the U.S. State Department spent $23,520 on waterproof lighting for the U.S. Embassy fence to commemorate Pride Month, from June 1 to June 30, 2021.

In the obscure reaches of South America lies the Republic of Guyana, a nation so elusive it evades the gaze of even the most seasoned cartographers. Yet, in a bold and defiant act, the U.S. State Department adorned its embassy fence there with vibrant Pride Month regalia, thrusting this hidden gem into the spotlight of global celebration.

Between Dec 29, 2016 and Feb 01, 2025 the state department awarded $723.6 Million to BL Harbert International LLC for the new embassy in Beirut. Some may say that's not a lot but ask your self this. How many billionaires out there made 723 million in just 9 years?  
The U.S. Tax payers keep paying for extremely inflated projects across the world.

    Obama Visit to Poland.
On May 14–15, 2025, former President Obama visited Poland to deliver a speech before a significant election, raising concerns about interference in another nation's domestic affairs. The trip's lodging, costing $27,372.90, was funded by U.S. taxpayers through the State Department, which used an undisclosed company for the payments. Efforts by myself, @DataRepublican, @doge, @Igotqueries, and others have exposed such spending, prompting the government to obscure payment details to avoid scrutiny.

Earlier @pepesgrandma reported how Sen Murphy working with far left organizations like MoveOn and few others to overthrow the Serbian Gov. The Org's in Question they have operations all over the EU and south America. 

Below I was able to track Sen Murphy's few travel trips funded by tax payers dates all the back to 2011 that was paid by Tax payers to accomplish his deeds. Below are few examples.

1- Jul 28, 2023 Ireland $16,806 Local elections in northern Ireland 
2- Jul 27, 2022 Brazil $10,712 right before the Brazilian Election 
3- Sep 30, 2013 Russia $3,095 this tracks when Alexei Navalny was running for office in a gubernatorial race

PS There are other trips In Belgium, Sweden and France as well   

Looks like @ChrisMurphyCT been violating the logan Act since 2011

    You may want to look into his company.  Mike Pompeo, Brian Bulatao, Ulrich Brechbuhl, or Michael Stradinger—the West Point classmates who co-founded Thayer Aerospace (later Nex-Tech Aerospace)—some of these individuals, particularly Pompeo and Bulatao, later held roles in government that involved significant interaction with the intelligence community, which has fueled speculation about earlier connections. Keep in mind State&CIA are interchangeable 

Mike Pompeo
Background: A 1986 West Point graduate, Pompeo served as a cavalry officer in the U.S. Army until 1991, including patrols along the Iron Curtain. He attended Harvard Law, worked as a lawyer before co-founding Thayer Aerospace.

Pompeo served as Director of the CIA (2017–2018) he was Secretary of State (2018–2021), 
•Speculation:  His rapid rise in politics and Koch Industries’ investment in Thayer as circumstantial evidence.
•Koch Connection: Thayer Aerospace received significant funding from Koch Industries, a conglomerate with ties to libertarian and conservative political networks. Some speculative narratives allege Koch-funded ventures indirectly intersect with intelligence interests due to their political influence.

Brian Bulatao
•Background: A West Point classmate of Pompeo’s, Bulatao co-founded Thayer Aerospace and served as its chief operating officer. He later joined Pompeo in founding Sentry International, an oilfield equipment company, in 1998. Pompeo and big oil and Ukraine/Russia. !!!
•Bulatao served as Under Secretary of State for Management (2018–2021) under Pompeo, a role involving oversight of State Department operations, including security and coordination with intelligence agencies (CIA belly button). He was also briefly the Chief Operating Officer of the CIA during Pompeo’s tenure as director which is the gatekeeping #3 job, a position directly tied to the agency’s operational management.

Ulrich Brechbuhl
•Background: Another West Point classmate, Brechbuhl co-founded Thayer Aerospace but left the company early to pursue other ventures. He later worked as a lawyer and executive, including at Bank of America. Notorious for money laundering CIA operations. 
•Later Intelligence Ties: Brechbuhl served as Counselor of the State Department (2018–2021) under Pompeo, a senior advisory role that involves strategic and diplomatic issues, including coordination with intelligence agencies. During his tenure, he was involved in controversial actions, such as accompanying Pompeo to Ukraine in 2019 amid the Trump impeachment inquiry, which drew scrutiny for potential intelligence-related implications. Again, Ukraine. 

Michael Stradinger
•Background: The least publicly documented of the four, Stradinger was a West Point classmate who co-founded Thayer Aerospace but left early. Little is known about his subsequent career, as he has maintained a low public profile.

According to reports, Mike Pompeo is currently in Ukraine. I reviewed his post-office travels and found records of a 2023 trip with $11,830 in accommodation BELGIUM. Now I'm looking to see if the state department will log his visit properly and if taxpayers paid for the Ukraine trip. 

If you recall that @GenFlynn faced accusations of violating the Logan Act as part of an incoming administration. Meanwhile, others travel globally, engaging in undisclosed deals, yet face no accountability."

    SHOCKING EXCLUSIVE: Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal’s Lavish Kyiv Hotel Bills EXPOSED!
While Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal strut through Kyiv, Ukraine, jaw-dropping State Department records have just dropped on USA Spending, revealing their extravagant hotel expenses. On June 1, 2025, two staggering transactions surfaced: one for a mind-blowing $403,172 and another for an eye-popping $411,634. 
The question on everyone’s mind—what justifies this astronomical spending any why this much? 
Lets see if @BasedMikeLee will condemn this or not?

We did a little deep dive on the ABA and we found the following. ABA received 33.6 million just in 2024 from the U.S. Gov in which 18.23 million came from USAID alone. In Just 2024 ABA allocated 10.2 million dollars to Ukraine those 10.2 million came from the USAID award. Below is the exact transaction trail.
PS The ABA started receiving an increased amount of funding from the U.S. GOV since the end of 2020.

    Alert: Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Hollywood Connection. 
Kvartal 95, the Ukrainian entertainment company co-founded by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is primarily based in Kyiv. Their official site, http://kvartal95.com

Back in 2016, Zelenskyy told Prensario International that Kvartal 95 had agents working in Los Angeles and plans for a European agency, hinting at ambitions to expand westward. This aligns with their international push—think Servant of the People landing on Netflix and deals with Eccho Rights for global distribution. LA, being a hub for entertainment, makes sense as a touchpoint for such moves, but it’s more about representation than a physical HQ. Event listings, like a 2017 "Kvartal 95 New Show" at 4401 W 8th St, LA (from http://eventcartel.com), show they’ve performed there, likely tapping into the Ukrainian diaspora or comedy fans. These gigs don’t scream "relocation"—they’re one-offs, not a sign of moving operations.

Kvartal 95’s output includes movies like I, You, He, She (2018) and TV comedies like Svaty, with a focus on Russian- and Ukrainian-language content for broad appeal in the region. Before politics, Zelenskyy was its artistic director (2003-2011) and a key producer, leveraging partnerships with channels like 1+1, owned by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. Financially, it’s estimated to generate around $30 million annually, with Zelenskyy holding a 25% stake—valued at roughly $11 million by Forbes Ukraine in 2022—though he transferred his shares to partners like Serhiy Shefir upon entering office.

Who is Ihor Kolomoisky:
He is a Ukrainian oligarch, born February 13, 1963, in Dnipro (then Dnipropetrovsk), Soviet Ukraine. He’s a billionaire—Forbes pegged his net worth at $1 billion in 2021, down from $2.4 billion in 2014—known for wielding wealth, media, and political clout.

Election Night Analysis
The whole thing started with Tesla takedown. 
Let's examine the facts surrounding the recent election events in a clear and objective manner:

1- Brad Schimel's campaign struggled significantly until the final moments, receiving limited attention and support. The Republican National Committee (RNC) and several prominent Republican figures did not prioritize or effectively promote the campaign, resulting in minimal publicity.

2- Only a handful of influential MAGA-aligned accounts, such as @ScottPresler and @DataRepublican actively engaged in supporting this campaign. Many others focused primarily on sharing memes and casual posts to boost their own visibility, opting not to invest effort or resources into the campaign.

3- In the Florida races, Democratic candidates outspent their Republican counterparts by a ratio of 10 to 1, yet they still suffered double-digit losses.\

4- The Wisconsin Supreme Court maintained its existing 4-3 Democratic-leaning majority. While Republicans did not lose a seat, they were unable to      secure an additional one to shift the balance.

5- The passage of Voter ID legislation represents a positive development for election integrity.

6- From a strategic perspective, Democrats likely prioritized gaining two seats in Florida over securing the Wisconsin Supreme Court seat due to the fact they pumped in so much money that they out spent the republican 10 to 1.

    Urgent Update: Exposing Judge Susan Crawford Wisconsin Election and her Roots 
Judge Susan Crawford once lent her talents to Pines Bach LLP, a firm that, upon my relentless investigation, I’ve uncovered as a cesspool of deceit. This so-called "small business" shamelessly forged documents to siphon exorbitant PPP loans during the COVID chaos—loans meant to cap at a modest $50,000 for legitimate operations. 

Yet, between 2020 and 2021, Pines Bach LLP gorged itself on ill-gotten gains, pocketing two staggering SBA payments: $475,879.30 and $466,793.08. 

They danced away unscathed, mocking justice itself. If your foundations are rooted in such a swamp of corruption, you have no business wielding a gavel from the bench.

    DOJ Swatting Prevention Money Allocation in Oregon and Washington High-Schools
In Oct 01, 2023 The DOJ allocated $244,026 to Republic School District #309 in rural Ferry County, Washington, recently faced a swatting hoax—a false emergency report triggering a tactical police response and lockdown. Serving 400 K-12 students and 2,000 residents, the district in the state’s second-poorest county struggles with an outdated security system (two-day recording, no remote access, failing sensors) and delayed emergency response due to only four deputies covering 2,300 square miles. The district, a community hub hosting events and wildfire operations, seeks funding for modern cameras and a school resource officer to quickly resolve such incidents, enhance safety, and supplement limited law enforcement.
Also, on Oct 01, 2023 WINSTON DILLARD SCHOOL DISTRICT $426,701 for similar issue with swatting and other issues. 

Looks like Washington State and Oregon are breeding ground for these type of activities.  

PS this is not a wasteful spending I'm just highlighting the Issue with swatting and the recent incidents with many Influencers being swatted due to the political views they have.

    Chief Justice Roberts’ Family Family Drama: Wife’s Law Ties and Cousin’s Gay Rights Push
First I want to make it clear that Chief Justice Roberts has no ties to any NGO's directly. 
However, His Wife worked at  Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman
A noteworthy detail emerges from a 2013 statement by Jean Podrasky, who identified herself as the first cousin of John Roberts. In a guest commentary published by the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), a non-governmental organization dedicated to advancing LGBTQ+ rights, Podrasky referenced her familial connection to Roberts while expressing support for marriage equality. This statement was made in anticipation of Supreme Court cases addressing Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). The commentary establishes a remote family link to an advocacy organization through Podrasky’s involvement, though it does not suggest that Roberts himself, or his immediate family—namely his wife or children—maintains any direct affiliation with the NCLR or comparable entities. 
"Source Is available on OSINT" 

PS  Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, a prominent law firm, has provided expert witness services in a limited number of cases associated with Supreme Court litigation. The firm, where John Roberts' wife was previously affiliated, contributed to these proceedings by supplying expert witnesses and offering legal drafting services to support the preparation of court documentation.

Below is just a simple example of how much they got paid to provide so called expert wittiness and paperwork preparation.

    Following @nicksortor's  arrest in Portland, I think the federal government should stop all grants and contracts to the city. Between 2021 and 2025, these totaled over $5 billion, with the Department of War (formerly DOD) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) each spending $1.66 billion.

    Department of Education:
On August 1, 2025, the Department of Education awarded Accenture Federal Services LLC a $168.1 million contract, potentially rising to $936.7 million, for managing Title IV financial aid origination, disbursement systems, and customer service transition services. This involves handling key aspects of federal student aid programs. Accenture Federal Services, known for its progressive corporate stance, has secured over $20 billion in government contracts and plays a significant role in various federal education initiatives across agencies Including the DOD 6.5 Billion Dollars.
What's concerning about this situation is that the company's Chief Strategy Officer "Bhaskar Ghosh" is an Indian national residing in India. This individual oversees the company's program strategy, which involves secret and top-secret contracts, allowing a foreign national to access all the sensitive data.
Additionally, look at the company donation from 2024.

    FORT BRAGG, North Carolina – Base housing debacle, Instagram photos showcase a lavish, crimson banquet hall at Capard House, a 100-acre Irish estate with two 18th-century mansions. Owned by Rhode Island real estate developer John Picerne, the estate boasts gilded mirrors, blue damask wallpaper, and a new personal golf course, redecorated with a top interior designer’s help. Meanwhile, tenant photos from North Carolina, Maryland, and Louisiana reveal a stark contrast: military homes plagued by flooding, burst pipes, mold, collapsed ceilings, exposed lead paint, and brown tap water. Picerne, through his company Corvias Group, controls both the luxurious Irish estate and these troubled residences. Since 2002, Corvias has managed over 26,000 homes and apartments on 13 U.S. military bases under the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, a 22-year-old program that privatized 206,000 federal housing units. Partnering with the Army and Air Force, Corvias builds, upgrades, and manages these properties for 50 years, generating hundreds of millions in annual rent from service members. The military claims the initiative improves living conditions for families, despite ongoing issues.

The reason I'm writing about this because I received a complaint from a military personal who lives on base housing in Ft Bragg. Also the Military Housing Privatization Initiative was created to hide the funding these companies receives and I validated that by looking up Corvias funding and I found only 350k from the mid 2000's which tracks with when the program started and why there is no funding after because of the privatization Act . 

PS Reuters reported on this issue back in 2018 and nothing changed. 
@PeteHegseth @SecDef This issue needs to be addressed and the funding should be public and transparent.

    Why is the U.S. government spending over $70 million on luxury Hyatt hotel rooms, especially given that the Pritzker family, with significant influence, holds a major stake in Hyatt Hotels Corporation?

By the way DOD takes the cake with overall spending with $51.8 million and just one contract for $16.9 Million between Jan 10, 2021 to Sep 30, 2021.

Pritzker Influence: The Pritzker family, with a 3.8% equity stake and 88.8% voting power in Hyatt Hotels Corporation, benefits indirectly from government contracts.

The company based in Iraq who received the money.  GOLDEN HANDS PRIVATE COMPANY FOR TRADING & GENERAL CONTRACTING, LTD. Located in AL-HURYAH 50 MT ST BLDG 8 BAGHDAD, IRAQ. With No history of contracting with the U.S. Gov except this contract we need to ask questions here. 
P.S. Al- Huryah district is just outside of Al Kadhimiya and its heavy Shia 'at dominated district. 
DOD hiring an Iraqi company that was established in Aug 2021 to only preform one contract starting in 2024 in Iran sound pretty shady.

    National Security Emergency: 
Shocking Conflict at MP Materials! 
MP Materials, tied to China's state-backed Shenghe Resources (8% stake), is cashing in on U.S. government contracts despite clear ties to the CCP. Shenghe buys rare earths from MP’s Mountain Pass Mine for processing in China, while the DOD and DOE funnel millions to MP, including:  
 $35M contract (2/17/2022)  

 $8.3M contract (8/31/2023)

This directly violates CFIUS policies banning U.S. business with CCP-linked firms. It’s a national security red flag, and accountability is needed NOW!  #HoldThemAccountable

    Alert: The IRS and treasury office of international affairs been giving out contracts to lawyers in large amount of money to perform services for Ukraine and other countries. I'm pretty positive this is not an audit for the money going there because the DOD admitted that they only reviewed 479 transactions to determine whether the DoD used Ukraine supplemental funds to pay for goods and services that supported the efforts in Ukraine. "Keyword reviewed" 
Below three recent examples of Ukraine. The list is very long.

    The truth came out

DC Lobbyist Desirée Townsend spoke with Congress Reps. The REAL REASON Democrats are fighting for illegal’s healthcare is because states like California have so many illegals their entire healthcare system runs on the taxpayer money for illegals

“Let's take California, for example.
California has a high demographic of individuals that are not here legally, and prior to the expansion of healthcare for them, the hospitals were inundated with people they could not handle. And so, when that expansion happened and immigrants who are here, undocumented immigrants that are here were able to get insurance, all of a sudden, you then had this new kind of revenue stream that came in not only to the hospitals but now to all these doctors and providers in California.

— California will be a catastrophe because you'll have all of these individuals now that are not documented with no health insurance. So, all of the providers that were making money off of this kind of, like, new economics in California are- are now not gonna be making any money. 

And instead, these individuals that are undocumented are gonna have to go to the hospital for treatment, and that's going to, instead of make the hospital money because they're covered by Medicaid, it's going to create a situation where now the hospitals are losing millions of dollars.

So, that is what I believe the sticking point is with Medicaid with Democrats. It has to do with a situation in states like California where you have millions and millions of undocumented individuals, um, and if they lose insurance, not only will the providers now not make money and the hospitals are not making money”

    HHS Spending in HIV Testing for Transgender and LGBTQ+ Communities.
Did you know that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has allocated $2.43 billion for HIV testing targeting transgender and other LGBTQ+ groups from 2015 to the present, with 90% of the funds spent since 2021? Active grants, such as a $75.8 million initiative in New York City running from 2024 to 2029, focus on LGBTQIA+ individuals aged 13–29. The graph highlights that New York and California leading the pack.

My earlier post hinted at a jaw-dropping $4 billion in funding following a Data Republican exposé on England’s refugee crisis. But brace yourself—the truth is far darker. A deeper dive reveals the UNHCR has raked in over $21 BILLION, with a grand total of $23.74 BILLION from the U.S. Department of State, $7.60 MILLION from USAID, and $5.22 MILLION from HHS. These colossal sums, flowing since 2008 and culminating in a chilling final payment on January 1, 2025, fuel the shadowy GLOBAL RESETTLEMENT INITIATIVE. @SecRubio This needs to be investigated and unveiled who's behind the destruction of the West?

Questions needs to be asked here:
1- Reuniting kids with WHO? Cartels? 
2- @MarioNawfal EXPOSED their crumbling shelters with proving reports and investigation of budlings lacking on basic services like showers and kitchens! 
3- Faking kid counts to STEAL taxpayer cash? 
4- Which government crooks are in on it?  

Since 2008, they’ve looted BILLIONS, allegedly under Obama’s orders, with Mayorkas plotting to CRASH America in a flood of illegals. And bring America to her Knees!  I found some receipts and it tracks with what Ryan investigate and it go's back all the way to 2008.

Below you will see one example of a recent grant for 75 Billion dollars. Another one for 22 millions for shelter and transportation services! 

PS the 75 Million Dollars contract still active till 2028.

    HHS Racist Mental Health BS Spending
If you wonder why the more we spend on mental health the worse it gets then the answer is below. 

On Sep 30, 2021 HHS awarded $503.7 Million to THE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK CITY, INC. For NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE AND DISASTER DISTRESS HELPLINE.

Who is their primary target?
NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING CALLERS; AND WORKING WITH LONG-STANDING PARTNERS TO IMPLEMENT TRAININGS AND ACCESS TO SPECIAL SERVICES FOR SUPPORTING LBGTQ, NATIVE AMERICAN, RURAL, AND BIPOC POPULATIONS TO EXPAND SERVICE AWARENESS OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT. 

This contract has 1 year and 5 months left and almost 100 million to claw back.

    HHS Racist Mental Health BS Spending
If you wonder why the more we spend on mental health the worse it gets then the answer is below. 

On Sep 30, 2021 HHS awarded $503.7 Million to THE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF NEW YORK CITY, INC. For NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE AND DISASTER DISTRESS HELPLINE.

Who is their primary target?
NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING CALLERS; AND WORKING WITH LONG-STANDING PARTNERS TO IMPLEMENT TRAININGS AND ACCESS TO SPECIAL SERVICES FOR SUPPORTING LBGTQ, NATIVE AMERICAN, RURAL, AND BIPOC POPULATIONS TO EXPAND SERVICE AWARENESS OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT. 

This contract has 1 year and 5 months left and almost 100 million to claw back.

    Seems you may be Ralph Hutton, a personal trainer and fitness coach for 9round in Springfield, VA.   Your Unlimited retail company doesn't show much movement, you were a Habitat for Humanity truck driver for a while, and a salesperson for a pawn broker.

If your latest gig is really 9round (https://x.com/9Round) you aren't abiding by their core principles --LOVE PEOPLE. Personal trainers and fitness coaches are supposed to be positive motivators, not sure Heather and Shannon Hudson, founders of 9round, would be ok with one of their fitness instructors spreading false criminal information online, which is actually NOT protected free speech.  Their core values per their website: The 9Round brand leads with love. It shines in our training style and our passion for helping people lead healthier lives.

In my opinion, your X account doesn't spread much love. The goal seems to be personal attacks for the sake of growing an X account.

Do better. Speak out all you want, even if we don't agree with you, but do it with truth, not made up crap.

    Exposé on Samidoun: Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network Funding
Samidoun, a Palestinian activist group, lacks transparency in its financial disclosures, leaving much of its funding structure opaque. However, investigations into available sources reveal key details about its financial backers and their contributions:
Alliance for Global Justice (AFGJ): Acts as a fiscal sponsor for Samidoun. AFGJ received a $258,673.96 SBA loan, raising questions about whether it was repaid and how much, if any, was funneled to Samidoun.

1- Tides Foundation: Provided nearly $300,000 in grants to Samidoun, funded indirectly through taxpayer money, highlighting public funds supporting the group’s activities.

2- Open Society Foundations: Backed by George Soros, this organization has contributed to Samidoun, aligning with its broader funding of activist causes.

3- New Venture Fund: Received $2.9 million from USAID and $522,000 from the U.S. Department of State, some of which supported Samidoun’s operations, indicating significant government-backed financing.

4- Arnold Ventures: Contributed over $3.2 million, with portions of this funding originating from government sources, further entangling Samidoun with public money.

These findings expose a complex web of funding, blending private, nonprofit, and government sources, raising concerns about accountability and the true scope of Samidoun’s financial network. @DataRepublican will help with the web of none government fundings.

Yes that's right you read the headline correctly. The US government Spent over 10 million dollars on popcorn and popcorn machines between 2021 and 2025 Here's some examples 
1- $111,145 on 04/25/2023 to SYSCO HAMPTON ROADS, INC for POPCORN, VARIETY.
2- $94,876 on 05/04/2023 to SYSCO HAMPTON ROADS, INC also POPCORN, VARIETY.  

PS I understand a good sum of those were going to military bases and I the search during COVID and most military MWR's were closed. 
Additionally, the SBA loans are very suspect as it sits for 9.5 million and again national science foundation 1.1 million

    The truth came out

DC Lobbyist Desirée Townsend spoke with Congress Reps. The REAL REASON Democrats are fighting for illegal’s healthcare is because states like California have so many illegals their entire healthcare system runs on the taxpayer money for illegals

“Let's take California, for example.
California has a high demographic of individuals that are not here legally, and prior to the expansion of healthcare for them, the hospitals were inundated with people they could not handle. And so, when that expansion happened and immigrants who are here, undocumented immigrants that are here were able to get insurance, all of a sudden, you then had this new kind of revenue stream that came in not only to the hospitals but now to all these doctors and providers in California.

— California will be a catastrophe because you'll have all of these individuals now that are not documented with no health insurance. So, all of the providers that were making money off of this kind of, like, new economics in California are- are now not gonna be making any money. 

And instead, these individuals that are undocumented are gonna have to go to the hospital for treatment, and that's going to, instead of make the hospital money because they're covered by Medicaid, it's going to create a situation where now the hospitals are losing millions of dollars.

So, that is what I believe the sticking point is with Medicaid with Democrats. It has to do with a situation in states like California where you have millions and millions of undocumented individuals, um, and if they lose insurance, not only will the providers now not make money and the hospitals are not making money”

    The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been linked to policies influencing illegal immigration into the EU, as discussed in a detailed thread by @DataRepublican, sparked by an image of a 12-year-old Scottish girl defending herself. The UNHCR, through its operations, has received significant funding from U.S. taxpayers via USAID and the State Department, totaling $8.45 billion. This includes three grants, each exceeding $1 billion, channeled through the Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les Réfugiés in Switzerland.

    The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been linked to policies influencing illegal immigration into the EU, as discussed in a detailed thread by @DataRepublican, sparked by an image of a 12-year-old Scottish girl defending herself. The UNHCR, through its operations, has received significant funding from U.S. taxpayers via USAID and the State Department, totaling $8.45 billion. This includes three grants, each exceeding $1 billion, channeled through the Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les Réfugiés in Switzerland.

    IOM Germany: On July 15, 2023, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Germany received a grant of $31.5 million to facilitate the processing of Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applications. However, concerns have been raised about the integrity of this process due to past issues. In 2010, the IOM was found to have falsified SIV and I-94 application documents, leading to the temporary suspension of the SIV program by the U.S. Department of State. Allegations suggest that the IOM charged applicants 10k to use authentic documents originally belonging to individuals who had worked with coalition forces, altering the names to facilitate immigration. 
I personally know five individuals from Iraq successfully immigrated to the United States through this method. Given this history, there are concerns that the recent funding to IOM Germany may involve processing unvetted Afghan applicants for U.S. entry. 
@DataRepublican just did a thread on this and how profitable illegal immigration is.

He specifically pointed out the International Organization for Migration (IOM, also known as OIM), which is one and the same NGO. Let's take a closer look at the total funding this NGO receives—nearly $10 billion from the U.S. government. In the second picture, you'll notice when the funding spike began. The third picture shows some of their contracts, which, by the way, span across the globe. The fourth picture provides an example of one such contract, detailing lodging and transportation for illegal migrants in Africa, funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

    Department of Education:
On August 1, 2025, the Department of Education awarded Accenture Federal Services LLC a $168.1 million contract, potentially rising to $936.7 million, for managing Title IV financial aid origination, disbursement systems, and customer service transition services. This involves handling key aspects of federal student aid programs. Accenture Federal Services, known for its progressive corporate stance, has secured over $20 billion in government contracts and plays a significant role in various federal education initiatives across agencies Including the DOD 6.5 Billion Dollars.
What's concerning about this situation is that the company's Chief Strategy Officer "Bhaskar Ghosh" is an Indian national residing in India. This individual oversees the company's program strategy, which involves secret and top-secret contracts, allowing a foreign national to access all the sensitive data.
Additionally, look at the company donation from 2024.

    NIH Racist Health Equity funding. 
On October 14, 2022, Pulse 2.0 reported that the University of Miami was awarded a $1.3 million grant to develop AI for addressing health disparities. This initiative is part of the university’s leadership in the NIH’s AIM-AHEAD program, focusing on AI and machine learning to promote health equity and researcher diversity. The grant supports collaboration with historically Black colleges, tribal colleges, and other minority-serving institutions to build a computing framework for sharing de-identified patient data, enhancing healthcare research quality and scope. 
The project is led by Azizi Seixas and Nicholas Tsinoremas. (Funding details in part two.)

    AOC’s direct Influence on a Green Energy Scam Contract: $800K for SUNY Maritime’s Offshore Wind Training in the Bronx!

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is pushing $800,000 to launch an offshore wind training program at SUNY Maritime College. This 12-month project will train and certify 150+ students and pros yearly, with a certified instructor, a decked-out vessel, a crew transfer platform, and scholarships. Set to supercharge the college’s rep and revenue, it’s a bold move for students, workers, and the green energy revolution!

Spoiler alert no one got trained as of yet. and the and below you will see to contract and the University donations heavy left. 
@AOC  what say you? And how much they donated to you?

    AOC’s direct Influence on a Green Energy Scam Contract: $800K for SUNY Maritime’s Offshore Wind Training in the Bronx!

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is pushing $800,000 to launch an offshore wind training program at SUNY Maritime College. This 12-month project will train and certify 150+ students and pros yearly, with a certified instructor, a decked-out vessel, a crew transfer platform, and scholarships. Set to supercharge the college’s rep and revenue, it’s a bold move for students, workers, and the green energy revolution!

Spoiler alert no one got trained as of yet. and the and below you will see to contract and the University donations heavy left. 
@AOC  what say you? And how much they donated to you?

    USAID Ran Disinformation Campaign to Influence Sierra Leone Presidential Election
On June 24, 2023, Julius Maada was reelected as president, reportedly aided by a USAID disinformation campaign launched in 2022 to support his reelection. The campaign targeted women and unspecified minority groups in Sierra Leone, though the nature of these minorities is unclear given the country's predominantly Black population. The operation was funded with $4.0 million.

If you thought USAID was the only agency buying condoms, think again. I traced State Department condom purchases back to 2004 across Africa, Asia and central Asia. 

Below is two examples between 2015-2016 one in South Africa for $7,806.78 and the other one In Sierra Leone for $3,173.21.

Unfulfilled Promises and Constituent Support
Dear @SpanbergerForVA, 
When you served in the House of Representatives, I met with one of your senior staff members in your Woodbridge, VA office, who made significant promises to assist me as a constituent. Unfortunately, those commitments were not honored, and my follow-up emails have been ignored. If your office struggles to support an individual constituent, how can you be trusted to effectively serve the millions of residents in Virginia? 
Attached below is the email exchange between myself and your staff member for Virginians to see who you really are 

Sincerely,
    ```

By cross-referencing, you can deduce that when politicians travel, the State Department logs the expenses. If you know of any representative or senator traveling outside the United States, let me know, and I’ll track the associated costs.

There is more I will be releasing at the appropriate time when the time comes. Stay Tuned.
Also If your congress member/ senator flying overseas let me know and i will find the trip cost.

    NEW: Abigail Spanberger’s $50K CCP Donation Linked to Hunter Biden’s Beijing Benefactor

Campaign-finance filings show Virginia gubernatorial hopeful (and ex-CIA officer) Abigail Spanberger pocketed two $25,000 checks this spring from Pin Ni, president of Wanxiang America—a Chinese company whose founder was hailed as an “National Outstanding Communist Party Member.”   

Hunter Biden’s laptop ties the very same Pin Ni to the Biden family racket: 

Days after Ni met Joe Biden at the White House in July 2014, he emailed Hunter about fixing—and later upgrading—Hunter’s $142,000 Fisker sports car after Wanxiang bought the bankrupt EV maker. 

Spanberger brands herself a “national-security” expert, yet she’s cashing checks from the CCP middleman who cozied up to both Bidens while the laptop exposed their foreign-cash pipeline.  

This is Deep State royalty in living color: an Obama-era spy turned politician, now financed by the same Beijing-linked bagman who greased the Biden machine.  

Virginians don’t need another governor wired into Hunter’s hard-drive scandals—they need a firewall against communist cash and the swamp creatures who keep taking it.

    Buckle up for a jaw-dropping reveal! Introducing PLOWSHARE GROUP, INC., the ultimate money making machine that’s struck gold with nearly $1 BILLION in contracts from HHS alone! One juicy deal? A staggering $458.8M contract running from 2020 to September 2025, with $268.4M already poured into get this the "CDC National Tobacco Education Campaign." Sounds noble, but is it? A quick peek at their website uncovers deep ties to NGOs and a donation trail that’s 100% blue, funneling every penny to Democrats. Coincidence or calculated? This isn’t just a cash flow it’s a cash flood! Dig deeper and follow the money!

    Portland: 
In light of the recent incident involving the unlawful arrest of Nick Sortor and the ongoing targeting of conservatives who have been supporting ICE personnel, I felt it was important to review and evaluate the federal funding being directed to the City of Portland.

Here’s one example of a federally funded contract I found:

Expand MCL’s capacity to provide follow-up support for high-risk 988 callers.

Improve coordination among crisis stabilization, respite, and mobile crisis services.

Strengthen partnerships with law enforcement to reduce unnecessary police involvement.

Enhance collaboration between 911 and 988 to ensure timely mental health responses.

Increase engagement with high-risk groups, including people of color, individuals in substance use treatment, people experiencing homelessness, and LGBTQ+ individuals.

The overall funding for BS programs for the city of Portland is over 14 millions.

One of the main players is Marxist-Leninist organization Freedom Road Socialist Organization (FRSO).

@DataRepublican  recent report highlighted that the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), a nonprofit organization, received federal government funding and also behind the riots. 
On June 6, 2025, David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) California, was detained during ICE raids in Los Angeles. Further investigation revealed that (SEIU) received substantial SBA bailout funds between 2020 and 2021, exceeding the maximum allowable amount.

    Exclusive Report Where Are the Kids?
 MVM Inc. DHS Funding. 

Following a tip from Ryan Matta, an independent journalist focused on NGOs and human trafficking, I investigated MVM Inc.’s government contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On March 31, 2020, MVM Inc. received $743,584,952.88 for Unaccompanied Alien Children and Family Units Transportation Services, later increased to $826,807,087.25. The contract was terminated on April 8, 2025.

The expenditure of over $826 million for transporting vulnerable populations raises serious concerns about oversight. Where are these kids? 

For transparency, the officials linked to this funding are Beth Davis (BETH.DAVIS@ICE.DHS.GOV), Pamela Odhiambo (PAMELA.ODHIAMBO@ICE.DHS.GOV), and JCapello7012. Given the implications for children, I felt it necessary to share the name and emails of those who been involved. Below is the receipts. 

Ps Over the years MVM Inc received over 3 billion dollars and spiked during the Biden admin. Below is the funding trends as well.

    Child Exploitation Gov Spending Scam Overseas

Check this out I found few contracts clocked under child exploitation and protection and human trafficking. 
The catch is the amount of money spent is very low to even open and investigation overseas. 

Below some example of these scam spending
 
1- 06/12/2024 to 06/22/2024 $69,629.83 for (DHS) Advanced Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking in THAILAND. However, this money was actually for hotel and rental cars 
2- 01/02/2025 to 01/12/2025 $12,849.45 for (DHS/ICE)Child Exploitation Human Trafficking Investigations again its also for hotel rooms and nothing to do with investigation

    Jeffrey Epstein: I’m uncertain about how to approach this, but it’s time to share some truth. During my time in the intelligence community, I searched for Epstein-related files on the Top Secret Network, including JWICS, SION (the FBI’s top-secret database), and GOLD. I found no records in Datatree, CELLEX, XRY, DIA reporting, NSA Pules, or CIA Wires, except for a single Intelligence Information Report (IIR) from 2004, which was sparse. It’s possible the files were never digitized due to incomplete big data integration. I suspect most original files have been destroyed by now, and the FBI is being misled. Under 18 U.S.C. § 793, the government can destroy evidence without question.

    Thread. Protecting the homeland: 
Lets explore the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and their influence on foreign investment in the united states 
CFIUS was established by an executive order in 1975 by Executive Order 11858, signed by President Gerald Ford.
Based on the latest update by congress CFIUS responsibilities. 
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), chaired by the Treasury Secretary, reviews foreign direct investment (FDI) for national security risks. It examines mergers, acquisitions, takeovers, certain noncontrolling investments in critical technologies, infrastructure, or sensitive data, and specific real estate deals. The President can suspend or block transactions threatening national security based on CFIUS recommendations. Despite the U.S. being a top FDI destination with an open investment policy, CFIUS focuses narrowly on security. Since 2016, Congress has increased scrutiny, particularly on Chinese investments and strategic sectors, following 2018 reforms and proposed legislation to address jurisdictional gaps.

I'm going to break down why the USDA is grossly unprepared for this renewed effort with their announcement today on "National Farm Security Action Plan" and why this won't work.

I'm going to share cases of property next to nuclear research facilities, sophisticated networks and strategies used, and how we can actually address this problem.

    National Security Emergency: 
Shocking Conflict at MP Materials! 
MP Materials, tied to China's state-backed Shenghe Resources (8% stake), is cashing in on U.S. government contracts despite clear ties to the CCP. Shenghe buys rare earths from MP’s Mountain Pass Mine for processing in China, while the DOD and DOE funnel millions to MP, including:  
 $35M contract (2/17/2022)  

 $8.3M contract (8/31/2023)

This directly violates CFIUS policies banning U.S. business with CCP-linked firms. It’s a national security red flag, and accountability is needed NOW!  #HoldThemAccountable
@ShawnRyan762 @SRS_jeremy Just did an interview with @realErikDPrince and Erik Bethel. And they talked about this.

    Albania: 
CDC's Influence on Global COVID Policies Through Funding and Partnerships.
I've recently discovered an organization closely linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that plays a key role in shaping health policies in other countries via financial support and grants. 
Allow me to introduce The Task Force for Global Health, Inc., a nonprofit based in Decatur, Georgia just a short distance from the CDC's headquarters in Atlanta. This proximity underscores the strong ties between the two entities, with The Task Force often partnering with the CDC on international initiatives, including vaccine distribution, disease surveillance, and public health strengthening in over 150 countries. 
A notable example is a CDC-funded grant channeled through The Task Force to support COVID-19 immunization and health system improvements in Albania. Valued at $54.8 million overall, the project has already disbursed $47.4 million, with the remainder still available for allocation as the initiative continues through 2026. This funding, part of broader CDC efforts to aid low- and middle-income nations like Albania in rolling out COVID-19 vaccines and building resilient public health infrastructure, highlights how U.S. resources indirectly influence global policy responses to the pandemic. 
Given the ongoing nature of the program, there may be opportunities to review or redirect the unspent funds to align with evolving priorities.

    Brace yourself: the Department of Health and Human Services unleashed a staggering $107.5 million on a single contract with Retractable Technologies Inc. in Maryland, all to secure 1ml syringes paired with 25G x 1" needles for the COVID-19 fight, spanning February 2021 to February 2022. This is but one deal in a web of contracts! Consider this: each needle costs a mere $0.08–$0.20, yet Maryland, with its 6,180,253 souls in 2023 per the US Census Bureau, bore witness to this colossal expenditure. What secrets lie in the shadows of such a monumental investment?

I'm not a math expert. However, someone please do the math here on how many shots on an average everyone took in MD based on the numbers. 

This is money laundering operation...

    Alert: CDC Cash Scandal: Millions Misused for false advertisement. 

I September 2020 the CDC paid CMGRP, INC. "an advertisement company" $67,730,491.45 for immunization promotion. The program falls under "NCIRD  Communications Support" NCIRD is "National Immunization and raspatory disease"

This contract was singed right before the rollout of the COVID 19 Vaccines and it was a 4 years obligation and the contract was closed in 11/12/2024.     

Additionally, the CDC paid the same company almost 700k for a project called "Uniting Ukraine"  with out any additional discerptions.  

FYI, this is just scratching the surface. The data is massive...

I'm pretty positive this is not an audit for the money going there because the DOD admitted that they only reviewed 479 transactions to determine whether the DoD used Ukraine supplemental funds to pay for goods and services that supported the efforts in Ukraine.
